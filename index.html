        <h2>Market Wizards Disclaimer - The Legal Fine Print (Because Lawyers Are Scarier Than Bear Markets)</h2>
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong> MarketWizardry.org is absolutely, positively, categorically NOT affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Jack D. Schwager's legendary "Market Wizards" book series. We just happened to pick a similar name because apparently we're as creative as a hedge fund's fee structure.</p>
        
        <p>While Jack Schwager interviewed genuinely successful traders who made fortunes through disciplined strategies and risk management, we document the trading adventures of degenerates who treat stop-losses as suggestions and risk management as a foreign concept. Think of us as the "Market Wizards" but if all the wizards were actually just college kids with Robinhood accounts and delusions of grandeur.</p>
        
        <p>Schwager's Market Wizards featured legends like Paul Tudor Jones, Ed Seykota, and Bruce Kovner - traders who built empires through skill and discipline. Our "wizards" are more likely to be found arguing about whether technical analysis works while their portfolios slowly bleed out like a punctured tire. We're the anti-Market Wizards, if you will - a cautionary tale wrapped in satirical commentary and held together by caffeine and spite.</p>
        
        <p>So if you're looking for the profound insights and proven strategies from Schwager's masterwork, you've taken a wrong turn somewhere. But if you want VaR calculations, volatility analysis, and financial tools delivered with the enthusiasm of a root canal and the optimism of a bankruptcy filing, welcome to MarketWizardry.org - where portfolios come to die and dreams get liquidated faster than a margin call.</p>
        
        <p><em>P.S. - Jack, if you're reading this, we're huge fans. Please don't sue us. We're barely profitable enough to afford ramen, let alone legal fees.</em></p>
