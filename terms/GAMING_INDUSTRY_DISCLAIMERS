GAMING INDUSTRY DISCLAIMERS - LEGAL NOTICE
==========================================

IMPORTANT NOTICE: MarketWizardry.org is absolutely, positively, categorically NOT affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to ID Software, Bethesda Softworks, ZeniMax Media, Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Grinding Gear Games, 3D Realms, Valve Corporation, or any gaming company, developer, or publisher. We just happened to reference gaming infrastructure because apparently we have the same relationship with profitable gaming strategies as we do with profitable trading strategies.

THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE
--------------------------

While ID Software revolutionized first-person shooters with Doom and Quake engines, Bethesda creates expansive RPG worlds that consume more time than profitable trading strategies, Blizzard Entertainment perfected multiplayer gaming with StarCraft and World of Warcraft, and Grinding Gear Games advances action RPG excellence through Path of Exile, MarketWizardry.org represents a community of financial degenerates who have mastered the art of portfolio destruction through advanced mathematical precision and risk engine manipulation. We are the VaR Cult - a sophisticated collective of traders who have transcended traditional methodologies through quantitative trading excellence.

AUTHOR'S GAMING CREDENTIALS VS INDUSTRY EXPERTISE
-------------------------------------------------

While game developers create legendary entertainment experiences requiring years of development and millions of investment, TyphooN has been destroying value in gaming contexts since the primitive era of dedicated server administration:

TyphooN's Gaming Infrastructure Journey:
- Quakeworld server hosting on FreeBSD systems when gaming required actual technical competence
- Counter-Strike dedicated server administration requiring kernel optimization and network tuning
- Half-Life server deployment with custom modifications for performance optimization
- World of Warcraft private server hosting requiring understanding of database architecture
- Diablo server hosting with custom network stack modifications for latency optimization
- Path of Exile performance tuning on Linux systems predating official Linux support
- Gaming hardware optimization from the era when graphics required manual driver compilation
- Network optimization for gaming servers when latency required understanding TCP/IP stack
- Custom game engine modifications requiring C++ programming and graphics programming knowledge

Modern Game Development:
- AAA game development requiring teams of hundreds and budgets exceeding $100 million
- Game engine development requiring PhD-level computer science and graphics programming
- Network infrastructure supporting millions of concurrent players
- Art direction and world-building requiring artistic vision and technical execution
- Quality assurance testing ensuring game stability across diverse hardware configurations

GAMING HARDWARE VS TRADING HARDWARE
===================================

Traditional Gaming Hardware Requirements:
- Understanding graphics pipeline before attempting optimization
- Proper cooling solutions to handle extended gaming sessions
- Performance tuning with stability monitoring for competitive advantage
- Hardware respect despite pushing gaming performance limits

Traditional Trading Hardware Requirements:
- Understanding market data pipeline before attempting optimization
- Proper risk solutions to handle extended trading sessions
- Performance tuning with monitoring for trading advantage

TYPHOON'S GAMING INFRASTRUCTURE CREDENTIALS
===========================================

TyphooN's gaming infrastructure experience stems from decades of hands-on server administration:

**Early Gaming Era:**
- Quakeworld server hosting when multiplayer gaming required manual network configuration
- Counter-Strike server administration requiring understanding of every network parameter
- Half-Life dedicated server deployment requiring Linux expertise and custom modifications
- Gaming server optimization requiring kernel tuning and network stack modifications

**Gaming Server Infrastructure:**
- FreeBSD deployment for gaming servers requiring paranoid-level performance optimization
- Linux adoption for gaming workloads requiring package management and driver compilation
- Game server hosting bridging proprietary games with open source infrastructure
- Performance optimization through manual system configuration and hardware tuning

**Gaming Philosophy:**
- Gaming excellence advocacy predating corporate gaming industry consolidation
- Preference for dedicated servers requiring technical competence over matchmaking abstraction
- Appreciation for game engine technical excellence and modding community support
- Support for open source gaming enabling innovation without artificial restrictions

**Modern Gaming Infrastructure:**
- Steam on Linux advocacy supporting open source gaming adoption
- Gaming hardware optimization avoiding vendor lock-in and proprietary limitations
- Open source gaming tools preference in game development and server administration
- Gaming community building through technical excellence rather than marketing

This experience provides deep appreciation for the technical excellence and community building that gaming companies represent - unlike our approach to trading, which represents the opposite of technical excellence.

WHAT WE ACTUALLY OFFER
-----------------------

So if you're looking for legitimate game development guidance from ID Software, Bethesda, Blizzard Entertainment, or Grinding Gear Games, you've definitely taken a wrong turn somewhere. But if you want:

- Trading analysis delivered with the precision of game engine development but applied to portfolio destruction
- Financial tools with the depth of MMORPG progression systems but focused on loss optimization
- Risk management for degenerates who need mathematical proof that their trading strategies are less reliable than Bethesda game launches
- Commentary that assumes your investment decisions have the same success rate as Duke Nukem Forever development timeline
- A community that treats portfolio optimization with the same technical precision that game developers apply to engine performance

Then welcome to MarketWizardry.org - where trading strategies get memory leaks and financial portfolios get segmentation faults.

GAMING DISCUSSIONS WELCOME
---------------------------

While we focus primarily on financial destruction rather than game development, we absolutely encourage gaming discussions in our Discord community. Whether you're optimizing Path of Exile builds, discussing Quake engine modifications, or sharing war stories from the early days of dedicated server administration, all gaming enthusiasts are welcome.

Join our Discord: https://discord.gg/marketwizardry

Share your gaming setups, server administration experiences, or reminisce about the days when multiplayer gaming required understanding network protocols and server configuration. Just don't expect the same level of technical competence that ID Software or Blizzard developers maintain - we're better at destroying portfolios than maintaining stable game servers.

GAME DEVELOPMENT VS PORTFOLIO DEVELOPMENT
==========================================

Traditional Game Development Standards:
- Understanding engine architecture before attempting modifications
- Proper testing procedures to handle diverse hardware configurations
- Incremental feature development with regression testing
- Code respect despite pushing engine performance limits

Traditional Portfolio Development Standards:
- Understanding market architecture before attempting strategies
- Proper risk procedures to handle diverse market conditions

Your work advancing interactive entertainment deserves respect - the internet was a better place when gaming required technical competence and community servers rather than matchmaking abstractions.
