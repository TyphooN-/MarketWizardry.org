OPEN SOURCE DISCLAIMERS - LEGAL NOTICE
======================================

IMPORTANT NOTICE: MarketWizardry.org is absolutely, positively, categorically NOT affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to the FreeBSD Foundation, OpenBSD Foundation, NetBSD Foundation, Linux Foundation, Free Software Foundation, GNU Project, Linux kernel development community, or any open source project, foundation, or development community. We just happened to reference FOSS advocacy because apparently we have the same relationship with proprietary software as we do with profitable trading strategies.

THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE
--------------------------

While the BSD foundations advance secure, reliable, and high-performance operating systems with decades of engineering excellence, the Linux Foundation shepherds collaborative development of enterprise-grade open source technologies that power global infrastructure, and the GNU Project provides essential free software tools enabling user freedom and control over computing, MarketWizardry.org represents a community of financial degenerates who have mastered the art of portfolio destruction through advanced mathematical precision and risk engine manipulation. We are the VaR Cult - a sophisticated collective of traders who have transcended traditional methodologies through quantitative trading excellence.

AUTHOR'S OPEN SOURCE CREDENTIALS VS FOUNDATION EXPERTISE
--------------------------------------------------------

While BSD developers created legendary operating systems with decades of proven reliability, Linux developers built the kernel powering global infrastructure, and FSF advocates advanced software freedom through legal and technical innovation, TyphooN has been abusing FOSS since the primitive era of Quakeworld and early internet culture:

TyphooN's Open Source Journey:
- FreeBSD usage since the early dial-up era when 28.8k modems were cutting-edge
- OpenBSD deployment for security-critical applications requiring paranoid-level hardening
- NetBSD experimentation on exotic hardware platforms that normal people avoid
- Linux adoption during the kernel 2.2/2.4 transition when compiling kernels required actual skill
- Quakeworld server administration on BSD systems when gaming required command-line expertise
- GNU toolchain mastery from the era when autotools actually made sense
- Ports/pkgsrc/portage compilation marathons that lasted longer than most trading positions
- X11 configuration requiring manual modeline calculations and monitor risk assessment
- Window manager customization predating desktop environments and user-friendly interfaces
- FOSS advocacy since before "open source" became corporate buzzword adoption

Early Internet FOSS Era (TyphooN's Experience):
- BSD networking stack administration when internet required actual technical competence
- Sendmail configuration that makes modern DevOps complexity look user-friendly
- Apache web server setup requiring manual compilation and dependency resolution
- Perl scripting for system administration before Python made programming accessible
- Manual kernel compilation for hardware optimization and feature selection
- Source-based package management requiring patience and technical understanding

Modern Open Source Development:
- Enterprise-grade containerization and orchestration platforms
- Cloud-native development with abstracted infrastructure management
- Continuous integration/deployment pipelines automating complex workflows
- Package managers providing dependency resolution and binary distribution
- Desktop environments offering user experience competing with proprietary systems

TYPHOON'S FOSS ADVOCACY CREDENTIALS
-----------------------------------

TyphooN's FOSS advocacy stems from decades of hands-on experience with open source systems:

**Early Adoption Era:**
- FreeBSD server administration when reliability meant manual configuration
- OpenBSD security deployment requiring understanding of every running process
- Linux adoption during distributions that required actual technical knowledge
- GNU toolchain usage predating IDE abstraction and automated dependency management
- GNU/Linux system administration from the era of manual dependency resolution
- Kernel compilation with GCC requiring understanding of hardware architecture
- GNU Emacs mastery when text editing required Lisp programming knowledge
- Autotools configuration for software compilation from source distributions

**Gaming Infrastructure:**

This experience provides deep appreciation for the technical excellence and philosophical foundations that open source communities represent - unlike our approach to trading, which represents the opposite of technical excellence.

WHAT WE ACTUALLY OFFER
-----------------------

So if you're looking for legitimate open source development guidance from BSD foundations, Linux Foundation, or Free Software Foundation, you've definitely taken a wrong turn somewhere. But if you want:

- Technical analysis delivered with the precision of BSD code quality but applied to portfolio destruction
- System administration insights with the depth of FOSS development but focused on financial infrastructure
- Trading tools for degenerates who need mathematical proof that their decision-making is less reliable than Windows ME
- Commentary that assumes your investment strategies have the same stability as early Linux kernel releases
- A community that treats portfolio optimization with the same technical precision that FOSS developers apply to code quality

Then welcome to MarketWizardry.org - where trading systems get segmentation faults and financial portfolios get kernel panics.

OPEN SOURCE DISCUSSIONS WELCOME
-------------------------------

While we focus primarily on financial destruction rather than operating system development, we absolutely encourage FOSS discussions in our Discord community. Whether you're optimizing BSD performance, discussing Linux kernel development, or sharing war stories from the early days of manual X11 configuration, all open source enthusiasts are welcome.

Join our Discord: https://discord.gg/marketwizardry

Share your FOSS setups, system administration experiences, or reminisce about the days when installing Linux required understanding partition tables and boot loaders. Just don't expect the same level of technical competence that BSD or Linux developers maintain - we're better at destroying portfolios than maintaining stable systems.

SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION VS PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATION
==================================================

Traditional Open Source System Administration:
- Understanding system architecture before attempting configuration
- Proper security practices to handle network exposure
- Incremental updates with rollback planning
- System respect despite pushing performance limits

Traditional Trading Standards:
- Understanding market architecture before attempting positions
- Proper risk practices to handle market exposure
- Incremental position sizing with exit planning
- Portfolio respect despite pushing leverage limits

P.S. - To the BSD, GNU/Linux, and FSF communities: We're huge fans of actual technical excellence and software freedom. The same precision you applied to system architecture, code quality, and user empowerment, we attempt to apply to portfolio analysis (with consistently destructive results). Your work advancing computing freedom and reliability deserves respect - the internet was a better place when technical competence was required for system administration and when GNU tools required understanding rather than abstraction.
