MARKET WIZARDS DISCLAIMER - LEGAL NOTICE
=========================================

IMPORTANT NOTICE: MarketWizardry.org is absolutely, positively, categorically NOT affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Jack D. Schwager's legendary "Market Wizards" book series. We just happened to pick a similar name because apparently we're as creative as a hedge fund's fee structure.

THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE
--------------------------

While Jack Schwager interviewed genuinely successful traders who made fortunes through disciplined strategies and risk management, we document the trading adventures of degenerates who treat stop-losses as suggestions and risk management as a foreign concept. Think of us as the "Market Wizards" but if all the wizards were actually just college kids with Robinhood accounts and delusions of grandeur.

LEGENDARY TRADERS VS. OUR TRADERS
----------------------------------

Schwager's Market Wizards featured legends like:
- Paul Tudor Jones (Built a trading empire through macro analysis)
- Ed Seykota (Trend-following pioneer with exceptional returns)
- Bruce Kovner (Global macro trader with decades of success)
- Michael Marcus (Turned $30,000 into $80 million)
- Richard Dennis (The original Turtle Trading mentor)

Our "wizards" are more likely to be found:
- Arguing about whether technical analysis works while their portfolios slowly bleed out like a punctured tire
- Treating YOLO trades as a legitimate investment strategy
- Mistaking luck for skill and volatility for opportunity
- Using "diamond hands" as an excuse for poor risk management

WE ARE THE ANTI-MARKET WIZARDS
-------------------------------

We're the anti-Market Wizards, if you will - a cautionary tale wrapped in satirical commentary and held together by caffeine and spite. Where Schwager's subjects achieved consistent profitability through discipline and methodology, our community celebrates the art of sophisticated failure.

WHAT WE ACTUALLY OFFER
-----------------------

So if you're looking for the profound insights and proven strategies from Schwager's masterwork, you've taken a wrong turn somewhere. But if you want:

- VaR calculations delivered with the enthusiasm of a root canal
- Volatility analysis with the optimism of a bankruptcy filing  
- Financial tools for degenerates who need mathematical proof of their doom
- Trading commentary that assumes you've already accepted your fate
- A community that treats portfolio destruction as performance art

Then welcome to MarketWizardry.org - where portfolios come to die and dreams get liquidated faster than a margin call.
