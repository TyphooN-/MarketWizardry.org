GAMERS NEXUS DISCLAIMER - LEGAL NOTICE
======================================

IMPORTANT NOTICE: MarketWizardry.org is absolutely, positively, categorically NOT affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Gamers Nexus, Steve Burke, or any of their content. We just happened to use some of their imagery because apparently we have the same design sense as a GPU running at thermal throttle.

THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE
--------------------------

While Gamers Nexus conducts rigorous hardware testing with scientific methodology and investigative journalism, MarketWizardry.org represents a community of financial degenerates who have mastered the art of portfolio destruction through advanced mathematical precision and risk engine manipulation. We are the VaR Cult - a sophisticated collective of traders who have transcended traditional methodologies through quantitative trading excellence.

HARDWARE REVIEWS VS. TRADING REVIEWS
------------------------------------

Gamers Nexus provides:
- In-depth hardware analysis and benchmarking
- Consumer protection through investigative journalism
- Technical expertise in PC components and cooling solutions
- Professional reviews with scientific methodology
- Community education on hardware performance

MarketWizardry.org provides:
- In-depth analysis of portfolio destruction techniques
- Consumer protection through brutal trading reality checks
- Technical expertise in VaR manipulation and risk engine mastery
- Professional reviews of trading strategies with mathematical precision
- Community education on advanced quantitative trading methods

AUTHOR'S HARDWARE CREDENTIALS
-----------------------------

Unlike those YouTube reviewers who discovered overclocking last Tuesday, TyphooN has been abusing silicon since the Pentium 1 days when "overclocking" meant carefully moving jumpers while praying to the PC gods. Back when warranties actually mattered to people who weren't completely unhinged.

The legendary journey of silicon torture includes:
- Pentium 4 2.4C pushed to 3.8GHz (because apparently 2.4GHz wasn't enough suffering)
- Watercooling with Little River Whitewater/Storm G4 when custom loops required actual engineering skills
- Early Swiftech products back when they made real cooling solutions instead of RGB disco lights
- Athlon 64, Phenom II, and Bulldozer (yes, even the infamous space heaters)
- i7 3960X Extreme Edition (because extreme meant something back then)
- i7 5950X (RIP - died gloriously to voltage abuse as all good CPUs should)
- i7 6950X running at 1.45V 24/7 (warranty? we don't need no stinking warranty!)

Every single CPU mentioned has had its IHS lapped to flat copper perfection because apparently factory mounting solutions are for peasants. Warranty void stickers are merely suggestions around these parts - thermal compound and determination are the only things that matter.

PHYSICAL VOLTAGE MODIFICATIONS: THE LOST ART
--------------------------------------------

Back when overclocking required actual skill instead of clicking "Auto OC" in some RGB-infested software, TyphooN was performing the physical voltage modifications that separated the wheat from the chaff. We're talking about the golden era when:

- Vdroop mods were mandatory, not optional
- Vgpu modifications required steady hands and smaller soldering tips than modern "enthusiasts" have ever seen
- Vcore adjustments meant finding microscopic resistors on motherboards, not sliding pretty bars in BIOS
- 3.3V rail modifications to boost VDIMM with actual potentiometers soldered inside power supplies
- Direct 3.3V rail soldering to VDIMM pins behind the socket (because subtlety is for the weak)

Does anyone even remember when you had to crack open your PSU and install a potentiometer to boost the 3.3V output for proper memory overclocking? Or better yet, soldering the 3.3V rail directly to the VDIMM pins behind the socket for maximum voltage delivery? This was all in pursuit of pushing the legendary BH-5 memory chips to their absolute limits - back when Winbond BH-5 was the holy grail of overclocking. Of course not - because today's "overclockers" think extreme performance comes from downloading MSI Afterburner and moving a slider.

This was back when Xtremesystems.org was the holy grail of overclocking knowledge, where legends shared circuit diagrams and voltage modification guides that would make modern "enthusiasts" weep into their RGB keyboards. Back when FUGGER ruled the overclocking kingdom with an iron fist and zero tolerance for peasants who couldn't tell a capacitor from a resistor. Those were the days when forum moderators actually knew what they were talking about instead of just collecting post counts and rainbow badges.

These weren't "mods" - they were standard operating procedure for anyone serious about pushing silicon beyond its comfort zone. While modern enthusiasts argue about which RGB software to install, the real pioneers were wielding soldering irons and circuit diagrams like surgical instruments.

GPU EVOLUTION AND ENLIGHTENMENT
-------------------------------

The GPU journey reads like a history of graphics evolution:
- X800 Pro flashed to XT via BIOS modification (because paying extra for unlocked cores is for suckers)
- 9800 Pro similarly liberated to XT performance (software locks are merely inconveniences)
- Radeon 5870 mining Bitcoin when crypto was still a curiosity instead of a planetary disaster
- Every notable GPU generation from GTX 1080 → RTX 3060 → 6900 XT Liquid Devil

The enlightened conclusion: AMD GPU supremacy without the snake oil that is CUDA. While NVIDIA pushes proprietary nonsense, AMD delivers pure performance without the vendor lock-in propaganda.

WHAT WE ACTUALLY OFFER
-----------------------

So if you're looking for the authoritative hardware reviews and investigative journalism from Gamers Nexus, you've definitely taken a wrong turn somewhere. But if you want:

- GPU performance analysis applied to trading rig optimization
- Thermal management strategies for hardware running trading algorithms
- Technical specifications for building optimal trading workstations
- Commentary that assumes your hardware budget is already liquidated
- A community that treats GPU purchases with the same reckless abandon as margin trading

Then welcome to MarketWizardry.org - where hardware recommendations meet trading degeneracy.
