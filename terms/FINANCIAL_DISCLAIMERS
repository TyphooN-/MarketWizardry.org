FINANCIAL MEDIA DISCLAIMERS - LEGAL NOTICE
==========================================

IMPORTANT NOTICE: MarketWizardry.org is absolutely, positively, categorically NOT affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to ForexFactory.com, Jim Cramer, CNBC, Bloomberg, or any legitimate financial media organization. We just happened to focus on trading because apparently we have the same relationship with market analysis as a retail trader has with risk management.

THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE
--------------------------

While ForexFactory.com provides comprehensive forex market data, economic calendars, and trading forums for serious currency traders, MarketWizardry.org represents a community of financial degenerates who have mastered the art of portfolio destruction through advanced mathematical precision and risk engine manipulation. We are the VaR Cult - a sophisticated collective of traders who have transcended traditional methodologies through quantitative trading excellence.

FINANCIAL MEDIA VS. FINANCIAL MASOCHISM
---------------------------------------

ForexFactory.com provides:
- Real-time forex market data and economic calendars
- Professional trading forums and market analysis
- Currency pair analysis with institutional-grade insights
- Economic news impact analysis for serious forex traders
- Community education on foreign exchange markets

Jim Cramer/CNBC provides:
- Market analysis with theatrical entertainment value
- Stock recommendations with varying degrees of success
- Financial news coverage with mainstream media reach
- Investment advice for retail investors
- Market commentary with personality-driven presentation

Bloomberg provides:
- Professional-grade financial data and terminals
- Institutional market analysis and breaking news
- Global financial market coverage with serious journalism
- Economic data analysis for professional traders
- Financial information services that actually matter

MarketWizardry.org provides:
- Fake-time trading data with sarcastic commentary

- Portfolio destruction analysis with amateur-grade despair
- Economic news impact analysis for unserious portfolio destroyers
- Community education on advanced loss techniques

AUTHOR'S TRADING CREDENTIALS VS FINANCIAL MEDIA EXPERTISE
----------------------------------------------------------

While ForexFactory hosts professional forex traders, Jim Cramer entertains retail investors, and Bloomberg serves institutional clients, TyphooN has been destroying portfolios since the early days:

TyphooN's Trading Journey:
- Started with dial-up internet when trading platforms were primitive
- Witnessed the dot-com bubble burst while being completely unprepared
- Survived the 2008 financial crisis through sheer stubbornness
- Mastered VaR manipulation when risk management was still optional
- Developed advanced quantitative techniques for systematic loss generation

Professional Financial Media:
- Provides actual market analysis with institutional backing
- Offers trading tools that don't actively sabotage user success
- Maintains professional standards and regulatory compliance
- Delivers market insights that occasionally prove profitable
- Serves audiences who understand the difference between analysis and entertainment

TRADING PHILOSOPHY COMPARISON
-----------------------------

ForexFactory.com approach:

- Risk management education for sustainable trading

Jim Cramer approach:

- Investment advice delivery with variable accuracy rates

Bloomberg approach:

MarketWizardry.org approach:

- Risk destruction education for unsustainable trading

WHAT WE ACTUALLY OFFER
-----------------------

So if you're looking for professional forex analysis from ForexFactory, investment advice from Jim Cramer, or institutional data from Bloomberg, you've definitely taken a wrong turn somewhere. But if you want:

- VaR calculations delivered with the accuracy of a Magic 8-Ball but the confidence of Jim Cramer
- Volatility analysis with the entertainment value of CNBC but the utility of a broken economic calendar
- Financial tools for degenerates who need mathematical proof that their analysis is worse than throwing darts
- Trading commentary that assumes your market knowledge peaked during the dot-com bubble
- A community that treats portfolio destruction with the same precision that Bloomberg applies to financial reporting

Then welcome to MarketWizardry.org - where financial dreams come to die and market analysis goes to get ridiculed.

P.S. - To ForexFactory users, Jim Cramer viewers, and Bloomberg terminal subscribers: We're huge fans of actual financial analysis. The same precision you apply to market research, we attempt to apply to portfolio destruction (with consistently successful results in the wrong direction). Please don't report us to FINRA - our trading advice is so obviously terrible that it qualifies as performance art rather than investment guidance.
