Trading any financial market involves risk. All forms of trading carry a high level of risk so you should only speculate with money you can afford to lose. You can lose more than your initial deposit and stake. Please ensure your chosen method matches your investment objectives, familiarize yourself with the risks involved and if necessary seek independent advice.

NFA and CTFC Required Disclaimers: Trading in the Foreign Exchange market as well as in Futures Market and Options or in the Stock Market is a challenging opportunity where above average returns are available for educated and experienced investors who are willing to take above average risk. However, before deciding to participate in Foreign Exchange (FX) trading or in Trading Futures, Options or stocks, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite. Do not invest money you cannot afford to lose.
