DER8AUER DISCLAIMER - LEGAL NOTICE
==================================

IMPORTANT NOTICE: MarketWizardry.org is absolutely, positively, categorically NOT affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to der8auer, Roman Hartung, or any of their content. We just happened to reference extreme overclocking because apparently we have the same relationship with safety margins as a GPU running at -196°C.

THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE
--------------------------

While der8auer performs scientific extreme overclocking with liquid nitrogen, precision temperature monitoring, and world record attempts that push silicon beyond all reasonable limits, MarketWizardry.org represents a community of financial degenerates who have mastered the art of portfolio destruction through advanced mathematical precision and risk engine manipulation. We are the VaR Cult - a sophisticated collective of traders who have transcended traditional methodologies through quantitative trading excellence.

EXTREME OVERCLOCKING VS. EXTREME TRADING
----------------------------------------

der8auer provides:
- World-class extreme overclocking with liquid nitrogen cooling
- Precision hardware modification and delicate soldering work
- Scientific methodology in pushing hardware beyond factory specifications
- Professional overclocking competition participation and world records
- Community education on extreme cooling techniques and hardware limits

MarketWizardry.org provides:
- World-class portfolio destruction with leverage cooling
- Precision risk modification and delicate margin manipulation
- Scientific methodology in pushing portfolios beyond financial specifications
- Professional trading competition participation and loss records
- Community education on extreme cooling techniques for burning accounts

AUTHOR'S OVERCLOCKING CREDENTIALS VS DER8AUER'S MASTERY
-------------------------------------------------------

While der8auer achieves world records with liquid nitrogen and precision hardware modifications, TyphooN has been abusing silicon since the Pentium 1 days through different means:

TyphooN's Primitive Era:
- Little River Whitewater waterblocks when custom loops required engineering skills
- DangerDen Chevy heatercore radiators paired with Danner Mag5 pond pumps
- CoolerMaster Stacker STC01 cases requiring hole saw modifications
- Manual voltage modifications with soldering irons and resistor replacements
- 3.3V rail modifications directly to VDIMM pins behind sockets

der8auer's Professional Era:
- Liquid nitrogen cooling achieving sub-zero temperatures
- Precision hardware modifications with professional-grade equipment
- World record overclocking attempts with scientific methodology
- Custom cooling solutions that make our pond pumps look like toys
- Hardware analysis that combines extreme performance with actual expertise

HARDWARE MODIFICATION PHILOSOPHY
--------------------------------

der8auer approaches hardware modification with:
- Scientific precision and temperature monitoring
- Professional-grade equipment and safety protocols
- Methodical testing and world record aspirations
- Hardware respect combined with extreme performance goals

TyphooN approached hardware modification with:
- Reckless abandon and warranty voiding enthusiasm
- Automotive parts and aquarium equipment
- IHS lapping to flat copper because factory solutions were for peasants
- Hardware disrespect combined with voltage abuse goals

WHAT WE ACTUALLY OFFER
-----------------------

So if you're looking for world-class extreme overclocking expertise and liquid nitrogen cooling techniques from der8auer, you've definitely taken a wrong turn somewhere. But if you want:

- VaR calculations delivered with the thermal efficiency of liquid nitrogen but the precision of a pond pump
- Volatility analysis with the optimization of a world record attempt but the results of a failed overclock
- Financial tools for degenerates who need mathematical proof that their portfolio performance is worse than thermal throttling
- Trading commentary that assumes your risk management has the same safety margins as LN2 overclocking
- A community that treats portfolio destruction with the same precision der8auer applies to hardware modification

Then welcome to MarketWizardry.org - where trading dreams get overclocked beyond safe operating parameters.

EXTREME OVERCLOCKING VS EXTREME FINANCIAL RISK
----------------------------------------------

der8auer's approach to extreme overclocking mirrors everything that trading should be but isn't:

Extreme Overclocking Standards:
- Precise temperature monitoring and safety protocols
- Scientific methodology with repeatable results
- Hardware respect despite pushing extreme limits
- Professional equipment and controlled environments

Extreme Trading Standards:
- Emotional temperature monitoring and panic protocols
- YOLO methodology with unrepeatable disasters
- Portfolio disrespect while pushing extreme leverage
- Amateur equipment and uncontrolled emotions

P.S. - Roman, if you're reading this, we're huge fans of your extreme overclocking work. The same precision you apply to liquid nitrogen cooling, we attempt to apply to portfolio analysis (with significantly less successful results). Please don't liquid nitrogen cool our servers - our uptime is already more unstable than an overclocked CPU without adequate cooling.
