        "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/la-ripresa-di-ethereum-accelera-grazie-agli-afflussi-record-negli-etf-spot-statunitensi/",
        "body": "La ripresa di Ethereum si è rafforzata dopo che gli ETF spot su ETH negli Stati Uniti hanno registrato 547 milioni di dollari di afflussi netti in un solo giorno , ponendo fine a una serie negativa di cinque giorni consecutivi di deflussi. A guidare la giornata è stato il Fidelity FETH con 202 milioni di dollari, seguito dal BlackRock ETHA con 154 milioni di dollari. Attualmente, gli ETF su ETH gestiscono circa 27,5 miliardi di dollari, pari a circa il 5,4% della capitalizzazione di mercato circolante, un dato che segnala un rinnovato interesse istituzionale mentre il prezzo ha riconquistato il livello psicologico dei 4.000 dollari. Smart Money accumula Ethereum (ETH) mentre le riserve calano Dal punto di vista dei bilanci societari, le istituzioni continuano ad aumentare la loro esposizione. BitMine Immersion Technologies ha rivelato di detenere un tesoro aziendale di 2,65 milioni di ETH, il più grande tracciato tra i suoi pari, mentre Bit Digital prevede di raccogliere 100 milioni di dollari tramite una nota convertibile per acquisire ulteriore ETH, con la possibilità di scalare la classifica delle tesorerie più ricche. Sul fronte on-chain, i dati di CryptoQuant mostrano un calo delle riserve sugli exchange, segnale coerente con il trasferimento delle monete verso la custodia e lo staking: condizioni che storicamente riducono l’offerta circolante quando la domanda cresce. Previsioni Prezzo Ethereum: obiettivi a 4.500–5.000 $ Dal punto di vista tecnico, ETH ha registrato un rialzo di circa +250% dai minimi di ciclo. Alcuni analisti, come Ted Pillows, ritengono che una breve correzione potrebbe preparare il terreno per un movimento verso i 4.500–5.000 dollari, con la possibilità di raggiungere anche i 10.000 dollari in caso di condizioni macro e di liquidità favorevoli. Nel breve termine, mantenere chiusure sopra i 4.200–4.250 dollari manterrebbe i rialzisti in controllo; in caso contrario, il rischio è di una discesa verso l’area di supporto tra 3.800–3.600 dollari. Le integrazioni con la finanza tradizionale rafforzano Ethereum Oltre agli afflussi e alle tesorerie, progrediscono anche le integrazioni nel mondo TradFi. SWIFT ha testato la Layer-2 Linea di Ethereum insieme a BNP Paribas e BNY Mellon per la messaggistica di regolamento on-chain, mentre un progetto più ampio tra SWIFT e Consensys sta esplorando un registro blockchain per i pagamenti transfrontalieri 24/7. Se anche solo una piccola parte del volume di SWIFT si spostasse on-chain, potrebbe diventare un motore costante di domanda per lo spazio dei blocchi e per lo staking di ETH. Conclusione Afflussi record negli ETF, riduzione delle riserve sugli exchange e nuovi progetti con la finanza tradizionale rafforzano lo scenario rialzista di Ethereum sopra i 4.000 dollari. Sopra i 4.200 dollari, il percorso si apre verso i 4.500–5.000 dollari. Sotto tale livello, è probabile un sano retest nella fascia alta dei 3.000 dollari prima della prossima gamba rialzista. Per ora, le evidenze pendono dalla parte dei tori.",

        "body": "The cryptocurrency market registered a marginal decline over the past 24 hours as prominent altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) , Ripple (XRP) , and Solana (SOL), fell into bearish territory. However, Bitcoin (BTC) defied bearish trends and is up nearly 1%, trading around $114,542. The flagship cryptocurrency traded around $112,874 on Tuesday but recovered from this level to start October in positive territory. BTC reached an intraday high of $114,744 before moving to its current level of $114,506. Meanwhile, ETH is struggling to regain momentum, with selling pressure pushing it back into the red. The altcoin briefly crossed $4,200 but lost momentum after reaching this level and moved to its current level of $4,142, down almost 1%. XRP is down over 1%, while SOL is marginally up, trading around $209. DOGE traded around $0.233, while Cardano (ADA) is up 1.35%, trading around $0.805. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. However, Toncoin (TON) and Litecoin (LTC) bucked the bearish trend to register marginal increases. CZ Warns BNB Chain’s Official Account May Be Compromised Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has warned that the official X account of BNB Chain could be compromised. The breach came to light after the official account posted a suspicious link promoting a fake BSC rewards program. Zhao stated on his official account, “The BNB Chain X account may have been compromised. Please do not click on any links recently posted from this account. The teams are investigating and will share updates as soon as possible.” The suspicious post on the BNB Chain account urged users to vote on an upcoming BSC rewards site and claimed early rewards would be given to participants within 24 hours. The message included a phishing link to steal unsuspecting users’ digital assets and private data. The warning comes after Zhao said earlier that the BNB Chain account may have been compromised. Binance is yet to issue an official statement. Ripple, Coinbase, And BitGo Could Qualify As Custodians The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cleared the path for Ripple, BitGo, and Coinbase to become custodians for crypto assets. The regulator’s Division of Investment Management issued a no-action letter on September 30 in response to a request from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. The SEC’s latest guidance allows investment advisers to use state-chartered trust companies as custodians under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The letter implies the SEC will not pursue enforcement action if advisers follow the conditions outlined. To qualify as a custodian, state-chartered trusts must be governed by a US state banking authority like the Department of Financial Services in New York or the Division of Banking in South Dakota. The trusts must also provide independent control reports, audited financial statements that comply with GAAP, and custodial agreements forbidding the rehypothecation of client assets without their consent. It also outlines additional safeguards, including keeping client assets off the custodian’s balance sheet and periodic due diligence checks, including surprise audits. Trump Withdraws Brian Quintenz’s CFTC Nomination The Trump administration has withdrawn Brian Quintenz’s nomination as the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Quintenz confirmed the withdrawal, stating, “Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life. I am grateful to the president for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I look forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country.” The crypto industry vehemently backed Quintenz. However, his nomination was held up in Congress amid reported pushback from Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Quintenz had claimed the Winklevoss twins had interfered with his nomination and pressured President Donald Trump to drop his nomination. He also shared a series of texts between him and the Winklevoss twins on X, claiming Trump was being misled. Quintenz said at the time, “I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise. It’s my understanding that after this exchange, they contacted the president and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has bounced back to reclaim $115,000 after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $112,695. The flagship cryptocurrency rose by over 2% on Sunday to $112,000. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% and settled at $114,365. However, selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $112,695 before settling at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal drop. BTC is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,012. BTC’s start to October aligns with predictions that the bull market will resume in October. BTC and the broader cryptocurrency market suffered a substantial drop in September, with the flagship cryptocurrency falling to a low of $109,623 on September 25. Additionally, gold and traditional markets have posted record highs, and analysts expect BTC to catch up sooner rather than later. One analyst stated, “Bitcoin tends to follow gold, 3-4 months down the line. $BTC began to mimic gold’s ‘rise → pause → last minute spike’ pattern. If the correlation holds, $BTC is now ready for a last-minute spike through October/November, breaking out of its rising wedge.” According to 50TFunds CEO Dan Tapiero, Bitcoin’s October bull market is yet to begin. “Wake up. The bull market in Bitcoin has not started yet. Same price in gold terms as 5 years ago. Massive cup and handle leads to new upside price discovery. 4% short rates too high, Usd bear now, DC reg wind at back, Dats, Etfs, Stables, Defi, Rwas etc New world.” However, pro traders remain jittery about holding downside risks despite BTC’s recovery. This is because the derivatives markets show heightened fear. Investors are considering whether the metrics reflect market concerns or whether they are specific to the cryptocurrency market. BTC’s skew metric reached 5% on Tuesday before eventually returning to 8%, indicating a higher premium for put options. BTC’s skew metric generally ranges between -6% and 6% under normal conditions. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.41% to $115,282 on Sunday. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell by over 2% to $112,736. Sellers retained control on Tuesday with BTC falling 0.64% to a low of $111,502 before settling at $112,017. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 1% to reclaim $113,000 and settling at $113,348. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment returned on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, rising 0.61% but was back in the red on Saturday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $109,681. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $112,000 and settle at $112,197. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,365. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC fell to a low of $112,695 on Tuesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal decline. The price is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,209. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has bounced back during the ongoing session after falling to a low of $4,094 on Tuesday. The altcoin faced substantial selling pressure last week, but has made an equally strong recovery to reclaim key levels. It started the week positively, rising over 3% on Sunday and 1.78% on Monday to settle at $4,218. The price fell almost 2% on Tuesday before recovering and crossing $4,300 during the ongoing session. ETH has held firm despite the US government shutdown. The political uncertainty could delay crucial US macroeconomic data, leaving markets pessimistic. The first government shutdown under President Trump lasted for three days, while the second stretched 35 days, becoming the longest government shutdown in US history. However, John Glover, chief investment officer at Ledn, is optimistic about how markets will fare, stating, “While this was previously used as a way to force the holdouts in Congress to be more flexible in negotiations, it was largely seen both times as a very temporary situation, and risk markets, which initially sold off, bounced back quickly. The market will consider any dip in digital asset prices due to a shutdown as a buying opportunity.” Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion announced that its ETH treasury has crossed 2.65 million ETH tokens, worth $10.8 billion, following a series of acquisitions. The company recently purchased 234,846 ETH valued at $961.5 million, significantly expanding its market dominance. The firm’s total cash holdings crossed $11.6 billion as of September 28. It also holds 192 BTC, worth $21 million, a $157 million stake in WLD treasury firm Eightco, and $436 million in unencumbered cash reserves. BitMine aims to acquire 5% of ETH’s circulating supply, equalling 6.04 million tokens at current levels. ETH ended the previous weekend down almost 1% at $4,479. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 6% to $4,202, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $4,079. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH fell almost 1% to $4,166. The price registered a marginal drop on Wednesday before plunging nearly 7% on Thursday as bearish sentiment intensified. As a result, ETH fell below the crucial $4,000 mark and settled at $3,876. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH recovered on Friday, rising over 4% to reclaim $4,000 and settle at $4,014. The price registered a marginal drop on Saturday but regained momentum on Sunday, rising over 3% to settle at $4,144. Buyers retained control on Monday despite selling pressure as ETH rose almost 2% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,218. Despite the positive sentiment, the price fell nearly 2% on Tuesday and settled at $4,145. ETH has recovered during the ongoing session, up over 4% and trading around $4,317. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is up almost 4% as bullish sentiment returned after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $204. The altcoin has been on an upward trajectory since Friday, reaching $210 on Sunday. The price continued pushing higher on Saturday, reaching $212 before dropping over 2% to $208. The current session sees SOL at $216. Optimism around SOL has been rising after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted generic listing standards. The new listing standards have made the 19b-4 review clock irrelevant and shifted the approval process to S-1 registrations. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes a Solana ETF approval is a certainty. Balchunas stated on X, “Honestly, the odds are really 100% now. Generic listing standards make the 19b-4s and their ‘clock’ meaningless.” Before the change, 19b-4 filings triggered a statutory review clock, giving the SEC a fixed timeline of 240 days to approve or deny an ETF. However, that timeline has become approval after the approval of the “generic listing standards.” “That just leaves the S-1s waiting for formal green light from Corp Finance. And they just submitted amendment #4 for Solana. The baby could come any day. Be ready.” Jeffrey Ding, chief analyst at HashKey Group, believes a Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying, followed by a “sell the news” correction. “A Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying ahead of approval, followed by a potential ‘sell the news’ correction once launched—similar to what we saw with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.” SOL traded in bearish territory on Sunday (September 21), dropping 1.36%. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 7% to $220, but not before dropping to a low of $213. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as SOL fell over 3% and settled at $213. The price fell to an intraday low of $204 on Wednesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $211, ultimately falling 0.77%. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as SOL fell almost 9%, slipping below $200 and settling at $192. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, the price recovered on Friday, rising over 6% to reclaim $200 and settle at $205. Price action was mixed over the weekend, with SOL falling 0.83% on Saturday to $203. However, it was back in positive territory on Sunday, rising nearly 4% and settling at $210. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 1% to $212. Despite the positive sentiment, SOL was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping over 2% to $208. The price has increased by almost 4% during the current session, trading around $216. Celestia (TIA) Price Analysis Celestia (TIA) ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping over 2% to $1.683. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell almost 11% to a low of $1.413 before settling at $1.499. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell over 2% to $1.468. TIA fell 1.20% on Wednesday and over 6% on Thursday as bearish sentiment intensified. As a result, the price fell to a low of $1.337 before settling at $1.362. Source: TradingView Despite the selling pressure, TIA rebounded on Friday, rising nearly 5% and settling at $1.425. Price action was mixed over the weekend as TIA registered a marginal drop on Saturday before rising 0.32% on Sunday to settle at $1.419.

        "body": "Strategy (MSTR) will post a profit for the second quarter in a row in the third quarter thanks to a rise in the price of bitcoin (BTC). That would again qualify the company for potential S&P 500 inclusion. According to Jeff Walton , Chief Risk Officer of Strive, Strategy will have earned about $2.9 billion, or $10 per share thanks to bitcoin's move from about the $107,000 level to $114,000 at quarter's end. Over the past four quarters, MSTR will have earned roughly $22.80 per share. The analysis factors in an estimated deferred tax liability of $970 million, leaving a net income estimated at $2.9 billion. The analysis concludes with an estimated trailing twelve-month earnings per share (EPS) of $22.8, reflecting positive EPS in Q2 and an estimated positive EPS in Q3 2025 ($32.6 and $10.1, respectively) which offset negative results in Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. While positive trailing twelve-month EPS is one requirement for S&P 500 inclusion, other criteria include a positive latest quarter, more than 50% public float, and average daily trading volume above 250,000 shares — all of which MSTR has. The S&P 500 committee, though, is under no requirement to add a company just because it meets those criteria. The fourth quarter 2025 S&P 500 rebalancing is scheduled to take effect after the market closes on Dec. 19. STRC Increased Dividend Rate Beyond potential S&P 500 inclusion, Strategy increased its dividend rate on its perpetual preferred stock STRC from 10% to 10.25% and declared cash dividends payable Oct. 31, with guidance that rates will be evaluated using the five-day VWAP of STRC prior to the final trading day of each month, according to analyst Ben Werkman . STRC currently priced at $97 (within the $95 to $98.99 band), this resulted in a 25 basis point increase, and Strategy has indicated it will continue raising the rate to bring STRC closer to its $100 par value. MSTR shares are higher by 2.9% premarket alongside a 3% rise in the price of bitcoin to $116,700.",

(@Metaplanet_JP) October 1, 2025 Metaplanet CEO, Simon Gerovich, said the latest BTC purchase made the company the world’s fourth-largest publicly traded Bitcoin treasury company. Bitcoin Treasuries data shows that Strategy leads with 640,031 BTC in its holdings, followed by MARA Holdings with 52,477 BTC, and XXI with 43,514 BTC. The Japanese firm’s latest acquisition follows a $632 million BTC purchase announced on September 21. That purchase remains the company’s largest BTC acquisition to date. Gerovich also revealed that Metaplanet reported a quarterly revenue of 2.438 billion yen ($16.5 million) in the third quarter. The growth represents a 115.7% increase in revenue from the previous quarter. “Q3 results demonstrate operational scalability and strengthen the financial foundation for our planned Metaplanet preferred share issuance, which supports our broader Bitcoin Treasury strategy.” – Simon Gerovich , CEO of Metaplanet. Gerovich revealed that the company had revised its Q3 forecast, which represents a 100% increase in revenue and 88% increase in operating profit compared to its previous guidance. He also noted that Metaplanet has achieved a BTC Yield of 395.1% YTD 2025 From July 1 to September 30, 2025, the company’s BTC yield was 33%, down from 129.4% in the previous quarter.

Under Metaplanet’s 555 Million Plan, the company aims to raise a total of $5.4 million to purchase 210,000 BTC by 2027. Metaplanet’s stock is down 10.26% at the time of publication to 516 JPY, despite the announcement of the BTC purchase. Its share price is also down nearly 38% in the past 30 days, and up 44.34% year-to-date. Bitcoin Treasuries data reveals that Metaplanet has already generated an unrealized profit of over 7.5%. The analytics firm also showed that public companies hold over 1 million Bitcoin, worth about $116 billion. Bitcoin held by treasury companies now accounts for about 4.7% of BTC’s total supply.

        "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/la-ripresa-di-ethereum-accelera-grazie-agli-afflussi-record-negli-etf-spot-statunitensi/",
        "body": "La ripresa di Ethereum si è rafforzata dopo che gli ETF spot su ETH negli Stati Uniti hanno registrato 547 milioni di dollari di afflussi netti in un solo giorno , ponendo fine a una serie negativa di cinque giorni consecutivi di deflussi. A guidare la giornata è stato il Fidelity FETH con 202 milioni di dollari, seguito dal BlackRock ETHA con 154 milioni di dollari. Attualmente, gli ETF su ETH gestiscono circa 27,5 miliardi di dollari, pari a circa il 5,4% della capitalizzazione di mercato circolante, un dato che segnala un rinnovato interesse istituzionale mentre il prezzo ha riconquistato il livello psicologico dei 4.000 dollari. Smart Money accumula Ethereum (ETH) mentre le riserve calano Dal punto di vista dei bilanci societari, le istituzioni continuano ad aumentare la loro esposizione. BitMine Immersion Technologies ha rivelato di detenere un tesoro aziendale di 2,65 milioni di ETH, il più grande tracciato tra i suoi pari, mentre Bit Digital prevede di raccogliere 100 milioni di dollari tramite una nota convertibile per acquisire ulteriore ETH, con la possibilità di scalare la classifica delle tesorerie più ricche. Sul fronte on-chain, i dati di CryptoQuant mostrano un calo delle riserve sugli exchange, segnale coerente con il trasferimento delle monete verso la custodia e lo staking: condizioni che storicamente riducono l’offerta circolante quando la domanda cresce. Previsioni Prezzo Ethereum: obiettivi a 4.500–5.000 $ Dal punto di vista tecnico, ETH ha registrato un rialzo di circa +250% dai minimi di ciclo. Alcuni analisti, come Ted Pillows, ritengono che una breve correzione potrebbe preparare il terreno per un movimento verso i 4.500–5.000 dollari, con la possibilità di raggiungere anche i 10.000 dollari in caso di condizioni macro e di liquidità favorevoli. Nel breve termine, mantenere chiusure sopra i 4.200–4.250 dollari manterrebbe i rialzisti in controllo; in caso contrario, il rischio è di una discesa verso l’area di supporto tra 3.800–3.600 dollari. Le integrazioni con la finanza tradizionale rafforzano Ethereum Oltre agli afflussi e alle tesorerie, progrediscono anche le integrazioni nel mondo TradFi. SWIFT ha testato la Layer-2 Linea di Ethereum insieme a BNP Paribas e BNY Mellon per la messaggistica di regolamento on-chain, mentre un progetto più ampio tra SWIFT e Consensys sta esplorando un registro blockchain per i pagamenti transfrontalieri 24/7. Se anche solo una piccola parte del volume di SWIFT si spostasse on-chain, potrebbe diventare un motore costante di domanda per lo spazio dei blocchi e per lo staking di ETH. Conclusione Afflussi record negli ETF, riduzione delle riserve sugli exchange e nuovi progetti con la finanza tradizionale rafforzano lo scenario rialzista di Ethereum sopra i 4.000 dollari. Sopra i 4.200 dollari, il percorso si apre verso i 4.500–5.000 dollari. Sotto tale livello, è probabile un sano retest nella fascia alta dei 3.000 dollari prima della prossima gamba rialzista. Per ora, le evidenze pendono dalla parte dei tori.",

CZ Warns BNB Chain’s Official Account May Be Compromised Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has warned that the official X account of BNB Chain could be compromised. The breach came to light after the official account posted a suspicious link promoting a fake BSC rewards program. Zhao stated on his official account, “The BNB Chain X account may have been compromised. Please do not click on any links recently posted from this account. The teams are investigating and will share updates as soon as possible.” The suspicious post on the BNB Chain account urged users to vote on an upcoming BSC rewards site and claimed early rewards would be given to participants within 24 hours. The message included a phishing link to steal unsuspecting users’ digital assets and private data. The warning comes after Zhao said earlier that the BNB Chain account may have been compromised. Binance is yet to issue an official statement. Ripple, Coinbase, And BitGo Could Qualify As Custodians The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cleared the path for Ripple, BitGo, and Coinbase to become custodians for crypto assets. The regulator’s Division of Investment Management issued a no-action letter on September 30 in response to a request from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. The SEC’s latest guidance allows investment advisers to use state-chartered trust companies as custodians under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The letter implies the SEC will not pursue enforcement action if advisers follow the conditions outlined. To qualify as a custodian, state-chartered trusts must be governed by a US state banking authority like the Department of Financial Services in New York or the Division of Banking in South Dakota. The trusts must also provide independent control reports, audited financial statements that comply with GAAP, and custodial agreements forbidding the rehypothecation of client assets without their consent. It also outlines additional safeguards, including keeping client assets off the custodian’s balance sheet and periodic due diligence checks, including surprise audits. Trump Withdraws Brian Quintenz’s CFTC Nomination The Trump administration has withdrawn Brian Quintenz’s nomination as the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Quintenz confirmed the withdrawal, stating, “Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life. I am grateful to the president for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I look forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country.” The crypto industry vehemently backed Quintenz. However, his nomination was held up in Congress amid reported pushback from Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Quintenz had claimed the Winklevoss twins had interfered with his nomination and pressured President Donald Trump to drop his nomination. He also shared a series of texts between him and the Winklevoss twins on X, claiming Trump was being misled. Quintenz said at the time, “I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise. It’s my understanding that after this exchange, they contacted the president and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has bounced back to reclaim $115,000 after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $112,695. The flagship cryptocurrency rose by over 2% on Sunday to $112,000. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% and settled at $114,365. However, selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $112,695 before settling at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal drop. BTC is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,012. BTC’s start to October aligns with predictions that the bull market will resume in October. BTC and the broader cryptocurrency market suffered a substantial drop in September, with the flagship cryptocurrency falling to a low of $109,623 on September 25. Additionally, gold and traditional markets have posted record highs, and analysts expect BTC to catch up sooner rather than later. One analyst stated, “Bitcoin tends to follow gold, 3-4 months down the line. $BTC began to mimic gold’s ‘rise → pause → last minute spike’ pattern. If the correlation holds, $BTC is now ready for a last-minute spike through October/November, breaking out of its rising wedge.” According to 50TFunds CEO Dan Tapiero, Bitcoin’s October bull market is yet to begin. “Wake up. The bull market in Bitcoin has not started yet. Same price in gold terms as 5 years ago. Massive cup and handle leads to new upside price discovery. 4% short rates too high, Usd bear now, DC reg wind at back, Dats, Etfs, Stables, Defi, Rwas etc New world.” However, pro traders remain jittery about holding downside risks despite BTC’s recovery. This is because the derivatives markets show heightened fear. Investors are considering whether the metrics reflect market concerns or whether they are specific to the cryptocurrency market. BTC’s skew metric reached 5% on Tuesday before eventually returning to 8%, indicating a higher premium for put options. BTC’s skew metric generally ranges between -6% and 6% under normal conditions. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.41% to $115,282 on Sunday. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell by over 2% to $112,736. Sellers retained control on Tuesday with BTC falling 0.64% to a low of $111,502 before settling at $112,017. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 1% to reclaim $113,000 and settling at $113,348. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment returned on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, rising 0.61% but was back in the red on Saturday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $109,681. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $112,000 and settle at $112,197. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,365. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC fell to a low of $112,695 on Tuesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal decline. The price is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,209. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has bounced back during the ongoing session after falling to a low of $4,094 on Tuesday. The altcoin faced substantial selling pressure last week, but has made an equally strong recovery to reclaim key levels. It started the week positively, rising over 3% on Sunday and 1.78% on Monday to settle at $4,218. The price fell almost 2% on Tuesday before recovering and crossing $4,300 during the ongoing session. ETH has held firm despite the US government shutdown. The political uncertainty could delay crucial US macroeconomic data, leaving markets pessimistic. The first government shutdown under President Trump lasted for three days, while the second stretched 35 days, becoming the longest government shutdown in US history. However, John Glover, chief investment officer at Ledn, is optimistic about how markets will fare, stating, “While this was previously used as a way to force the holdouts in Congress to be more flexible in negotiations, it was largely seen both times as a very temporary situation, and risk markets, which initially sold off, bounced back quickly. The market will consider any dip in digital asset prices due to a shutdown as a buying opportunity.” Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion announced that its ETH treasury has crossed 2.65 million ETH tokens, worth $10.8 billion, following a series of acquisitions. The company recently purchased 234,846 ETH valued at $961.5 million, significantly expanding its market dominance. The firm’s total cash holdings crossed $11.6 billion as of September 28. It also holds 192 BTC, worth $21 million, a $157 million stake in WLD treasury firm Eightco, and $436 million in unencumbered cash reserves. BitMine aims to acquire 5% of ETH’s circulating supply, equalling 6.04 million tokens at current levels. ETH ended the previous weekend down almost 1% at $4,479. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 6% to $4,202, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $4,079. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH fell almost 1% to $4,166. The price registered a marginal drop on Wednesday before plunging nearly 7% on Thursday as bearish sentiment intensified. As a result, ETH fell below the crucial $4,000 mark and settled at $3,876. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH recovered on Friday, rising over 4% to reclaim $4,000 and settle at $4,014. The price registered a marginal drop on Saturday but regained momentum on Sunday, rising over 3% to settle at $4,144. Buyers retained control on Monday despite selling pressure as ETH rose almost 2% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,218. Despite the positive sentiment, the price fell nearly 2% on Tuesday and settled at $4,145. ETH has recovered during the ongoing session, up over 4% and trading around $4,317. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is up almost 4% as bullish sentiment returned after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $204. The altcoin has been on an upward trajectory since Friday, reaching $210 on Sunday. The price continued pushing higher on Saturday, reaching $212 before dropping over 2% to $208. The current session sees SOL at $216. Optimism around SOL has been rising after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted generic listing standards. The new listing standards have made the 19b-4 review clock irrelevant and shifted the approval process to S-1 registrations. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes a Solana ETF approval is a certainty. Balchunas stated on X, “Honestly, the odds are really 100% now. Generic listing standards make the 19b-4s and their ‘clock’ meaningless.” Before the change, 19b-4 filings triggered a statutory review clock, giving the SEC a fixed timeline of 240 days to approve or deny an ETF. However, that timeline has become approval after the approval of the “generic listing standards.” “That just leaves the S-1s waiting for formal green light from Corp Finance. And they just submitted amendment #4 for Solana. The baby could come any day. Be ready.” Jeffrey Ding, chief analyst at HashKey Group, believes a Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying, followed by a “sell the news” correction. “A Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying ahead of approval, followed by a potential ‘sell the news’ correction once launched—similar to what we saw with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.” SOL traded in bearish territory on Sunday (September 21), dropping 1.36%. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 7% to $220, but not before dropping to a low of $213. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as SOL fell over 3% and settled at $213.

        "body": "The cryptocurrency market registered a marginal decline over the past 24 hours as prominent altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) , Ripple (XRP) , and Solana (SOL), fell into bearish territory. However, Bitcoin (BTC) defied bearish trends and is up nearly 1%, trading around $114,542. The flagship cryptocurrency traded around $112,874 on Tuesday but recovered from this level to start October in positive territory. BTC reached an intraday high of $114,744 before moving to its current level of $114,506. Meanwhile, ETH is struggling to regain momentum, with selling pressure pushing it back into the red. The altcoin briefly crossed $4,200 but lost momentum after reaching this level and moved to its current level of $4,142, down almost 1%. XRP is down over 1%, while SOL is marginally up, trading around $209. DOGE traded around $0.233, while Cardano (ADA) is up 1.35%, trading around $0.805. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. However, Toncoin (TON) and Litecoin (LTC) bucked the bearish trend to register marginal increases. CZ Warns BNB Chain’s Official Account May Be Compromised Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has warned that the official X account of BNB Chain could be compromised. The breach came to light after the official account posted a suspicious link promoting a fake BSC rewards program. Zhao stated on his official account, “The BNB Chain X account may have been compromised. Please do not click on any links recently posted from this account. The teams are investigating and will share updates as soon as possible.” The suspicious post on the BNB Chain account urged users to vote on an upcoming BSC rewards site and claimed early rewards would be given to participants within 24 hours. The message included a phishing link to steal unsuspecting users’ digital assets and private data. The warning comes after Zhao said earlier that the BNB Chain account may have been compromised. Binance is yet to issue an official statement.

        "body": "With Bitcoin (BTC) in the midst of a key breakout, the altcoins are also beginning to run. Memecoins are usually at the forefront of crypto breakouts and $DOGE, $SHIB, and $PENGU, having held key support, are starting to apply the afterburners. $DOGE breakout - back to top of wedge pattern? Source: TradingView The daily chart for the $DOGE price shows a nice spike to the upside of around 5% on the day so far. The convergence of the ascending trendline with the horizontal support at $0.23 provided the platform needed for the bulls to begin their attempt at a breakout. It can be seen that a descending trendline is also adding resistance to the breakout, but if the bulls can pierce through this trendline as well, a strong surge could result. A target for the breakout is $0.32, which could coincide with the top of the wedge pattern. $SHIB spikes and hits resistance - a long way to go yet Source: TradingView Even though $SHIB has broken out of a long-standing descending trendline, and a more recent, and smaller descending trendline, the price has continued to travel sideways, with the $0.000011 horizontal level serving as major resistance and support. Wednesday’s surge to the upside has brought the price up 4.4% so far, and puts it right up against the $0.000012 resistance level. A breakout here could lead to further upside price action. $0.000016 and $0.0000176 are major resistance levels that will need to be surmounted in order to turn around a long-time down trend. $PENGU surges from support - back to top of bull flag? Source: TradingView The $PENGU price has been within a parallel channel since the end of July. The run-up into the top of the channel/bull flag was in the order of 520%, so it’s no wonder that this consolidation phase has taken more than two months so far. Today’s price spike to the upside has registered more than 10%, coming off of the excellent support base at $0.028. It has also pierced through a descending trendline, which probably accounts for the surge. The next resistance level is at $0.032, while the top of the channel is beyond that. Breaking out of the top of the channel could lead to much higher prices. A measured move would give a target of $0.065. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "body": "The crypto market is up today, with the cryptocurrency market capitalization increasing by just 0.2%, now standing at $4 trillion. Just over half of the top 100 coins have appreciated over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $164 billion. TLDR: The crypto market capitalization is up 0.2% on Wednesday morning (UTC); Only 2 of the top 10 coins are up, with BTC leading the green list; The market seems to be in the consolidation phase, which could be healthy for it; BTC is up to $114,540, and ETH is down to $4,139; The ‘uptober’ hype keeps growing – ‘this Uptober will see more targeted inflows, which could be a breakout moment in accelerating Bitcoin DeFi’; ’Capitulation stress often mark the end of downside phases, setting the stage for recovery’; Resets are noted what historically ‘align with periods of market detox, helping build a foundation for more durable recoveries’; Both US BTC and ETH spot ETFs continued recording inflows on Tuesday, with $429.96 million and $127.47 million, respectively; Tim Draper predicts future retail adoption of BTC; Crypto market sentiment is moving in a tight range within the neutral zone. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, only two top 10 coins per market capitalization have increased over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) appreciated 0.6%, currently trading at $114,540. It’s the best performer in the category. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) dropped by 1.1%, now changing hands at $4,139. This is the third-highest decrease today. Dogecoin (DOGE) is the only other green coin on this list, having increased by 0.6% to the price of $0.2334. The highest drop is XRP’s 1.4% to $2.85, followed by 1.2% by Binance Coin (BNB) , now standing at $1,010. When it comes to the top 100 coins, one coin saw a double-digit rise: Pump Fun (PUMP) is up 20.6% to $0.006514. Other coins are up 4.4% and less. On the other side, two coins recorded double-digit falls: Plasma (XPL) is down 14.4% to $0.96, while Aster (ASTER) dropped 11.2% to $1.62. As October begins, the ‘uptober’ hype keeps growing. Many expect to see the market rising, basing their arguments on historical performances. Meanwhile, Ripple CTO David Schwartz said he would step down from his role in the company at the end of the year after more than a decade. He will sit on the company’s board of directors and serve as CTO Emeritus. As happens in one’s life, I’ve been taking stock of my last 40 years. It’s been a wild ride. I’ve gone from consulting for the NSA to watching the early stages of Bitcoin. Then, I met Arthur, Jed, and Chris and worked on coding the XRP Ledger. Now, I’ve spent more than 13 years… — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) September 30, 2025 ‘We’re Approaching Cycle Bottom, Followed by Recovery’ According to Swissblock , “Bitcoin is in the process of finding a bottom.” They explain that markets move in cycles of stress and recovery, and when the former peaks, short-term traders are forced to sell at a loss. “Capitulation stress often marks the end of downside phases, setting the stage for recovery,” they write. “At that exact point, the Impulse Signal collapses to zero. That’s the moment panic exhausts and new buyers step in.” This reset happened only three times since early 2024: each marked a cycle bottom and was followed by a sustained recovery. “We are approaching that setup again.” 7/ The picture: Impulse moving toward 0 → bottoming process underway Risk reset → leverage cleared Liquidity strong → fundamentals intact Network growth + liquidity → historically bullish setup This is why we built Swissblock: clarity over noise. — Swissblock (@swissblock__) September 30, 2025 Moreover, Glassnode noted that Bitcoin market dominance increased by two percentage points to 59%, as the price increased as well. The analysts note that this suggests “a healthier market structure, as BTC-led rallies have historically proven more sustainable than those driven by altcoins.” Bitcoin dominance has rebounded from 57% to 59% alongside price strength near $114k. This mean reversion suggests a healthier market structure, as $BTC -led rallies have historically proven more sustainable than those driven by altcoins. https://t.co/eNInot0Wst pic.twitter.com/YHrKZWTBy8 — glassnode (@glassnode) October 1, 2025 Additionally, short-term holder RVT has compressed toward cycle lows, they write . This reflects “muted realized profits relative to network valuation.” Notably, such resets historically “often align with periods of market detox, helping build a foundation for more durable recoveries,” Glassnode says. ‘Transformative Uptober’ Furthermore, Dom Harz, Co-Founder of BOB , commented that “with Bitcoin’s price remaining stable above $111,000, the stage is set for a potentially transformative Uptober for Bitcoin DeFi. Historically, Uptober’s bullish momentum has been driven by seasonal optimism and whale accumulation; however, this year feels different.” He continues: “We have seen the convergence of both institutional backing and maturation across the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin is more embedded in the foundations of global finance, and institutional interest is at an all-time high. Unlike previous years, this Uptober will see more targeted inflows, which could be a breakout moment in accelerating Bitcoin DeFi, as investors will want to do more with their Bitcoin holdings, transforming it from a static store-of-value into a yield-bearing asset class.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Wednesday morning, BTC trades at $114,540. It initially dropped to the intraday low of $112,736 before jumping to the daily high of $114,711. The coin is currently up 1.7% in a week and 6% in a month. Bitcoin is consolidating near $114,154. Should it move above $114,741, the coin could jump toward $116,150 and $117,850. After this, $120,000 would be possible as well. But a drop below $113,000 could lead to $112,600 and $111,680.

Conversely, it could climb above $4,200, which could open doors for the $4,250 and $4,300 levels.

        "body": "The cryptocurrency market registered a marginal decline over the past 24 hours as prominent altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) , Ripple (XRP) , and Solana (SOL), fell into bearish territory. However, Bitcoin (BTC) defied bearish trends and is up nearly 1%, trading around $114,542. The flagship cryptocurrency traded around $112,874 on Tuesday but recovered from this level to start October in positive territory. BTC reached an intraday high of $114,744 before moving to its current level of $114,506. Meanwhile, ETH is struggling to regain momentum, with selling pressure pushing it back into the red. The altcoin briefly crossed $4,200 but lost momentum after reaching this level and moved to its current level of $4,142, down almost 1%. XRP is down over 1%, while SOL is marginally up, trading around $209. DOGE traded around $0.233, while Cardano (ADA) is up 1.35%, trading around $0.805. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. However, Toncoin (TON) and Litecoin (LTC) bucked the bearish trend to register marginal increases. CZ Warns BNB Chain’s Official Account May Be Compromised Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has warned that the official X account of BNB Chain could be compromised. The breach came to light after the official account posted a suspicious link promoting a fake BSC rewards program. Zhao stated on his official account, “The BNB Chain X account may have been compromised. Please do not click on any links recently posted from this account. The teams are investigating and will share updates as soon as possible.” The suspicious post on the BNB Chain account urged users to vote on an upcoming BSC rewards site and claimed early rewards would be given to participants within 24 hours. The message included a phishing link to steal unsuspecting users’ digital assets and private data. The warning comes after Zhao said earlier that the BNB Chain account may have been compromised. Binance is yet to issue an official statement. Ripple, Coinbase, And BitGo Could Qualify As Custodians The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cleared the path for Ripple, BitGo, and Coinbase to become custodians for crypto assets. The regulator’s Division of Investment Management issued a no-action letter on September 30 in response to a request from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. The SEC’s latest guidance allows investment advisers to use state-chartered trust companies as custodians under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The letter implies the SEC will not pursue enforcement action if advisers follow the conditions outlined. To qualify as a custodian, state-chartered trusts must be governed by a US state banking authority like the Department of Financial Services in New York or the Division of Banking in South Dakota. The trusts must also provide independent control reports, audited financial statements that comply with GAAP, and custodial agreements forbidding the rehypothecation of client assets without their consent. It also outlines additional safeguards, including keeping client assets off the custodian’s balance sheet and periodic due diligence checks, including surprise audits. Trump Withdraws Brian Quintenz’s CFTC Nomination The Trump administration has withdrawn Brian Quintenz’s nomination as the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Quintenz confirmed the withdrawal, stating, “Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life. I am grateful to the president for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I look forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country.” The crypto industry vehemently backed Quintenz. However, his nomination was held up in Congress amid reported pushback from Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Quintenz had claimed the Winklevoss twins had interfered with his nomination and pressured President Donald Trump to drop his nomination. He also shared a series of texts between him and the Winklevoss twins on X, claiming Trump was being misled. Quintenz said at the time, “I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise. It’s my understanding that after this exchange, they contacted the president and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has bounced back to reclaim $115,000 after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $112,695. The flagship cryptocurrency rose by over 2% on Sunday to $112,000. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% and settled at $114,365. However, selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $112,695 before settling at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal drop. BTC is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,012. BTC’s start to October aligns with predictions that the bull market will resume in October. BTC and the broader cryptocurrency market suffered a substantial drop in September, with the flagship cryptocurrency falling to a low of $109,623 on September 25. Additionally, gold and traditional markets have posted record highs, and analysts expect BTC to catch up sooner rather than later. One analyst stated, “Bitcoin tends to follow gold, 3-4 months down the line. $BTC began to mimic gold’s ‘rise → pause → last minute spike’ pattern. If the correlation holds, $BTC is now ready for a last-minute spike through October/November, breaking out of its rising wedge.” According to 50TFunds CEO Dan Tapiero, Bitcoin’s October bull market is yet to begin. “Wake up. The bull market in Bitcoin has not started yet. Same price in gold terms as 5 years ago. Massive cup and handle leads to new upside price discovery. 4% short rates too high, Usd bear now, DC reg wind at back, Dats, Etfs, Stables, Defi, Rwas etc New world.” However, pro traders remain jittery about holding downside risks despite BTC’s recovery. This is because the derivatives markets show heightened fear. Investors are considering whether the metrics reflect market concerns or whether they are specific to the cryptocurrency market. BTC’s skew metric reached 5% on Tuesday before eventually returning to 8%, indicating a higher premium for put options. BTC’s skew metric generally ranges between -6% and 6% under normal conditions. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.41% to $115,282 on Sunday. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell by over 2% to $112,736. Sellers retained control on Tuesday with BTC falling 0.64% to a low of $111,502 before settling at $112,017. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 1% to reclaim $113,000 and settling at $113,348. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment returned on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, rising 0.61% but was back in the red on Saturday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $109,681. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $112,000 and settle at $112,197. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,365. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC fell to a low of $112,695 on Tuesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal decline. The price is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,209. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has bounced back during the ongoing session after falling to a low of $4,094 on Tuesday. The altcoin faced substantial selling pressure last week, but has made an equally strong recovery to reclaim key levels. It started the week positively, rising over 3% on Sunday and 1.78% on Monday to settle at $4,218. The price fell almost 2% on Tuesday before recovering and crossing $4,300 during the ongoing session. ETH has held firm despite the US government shutdown. The political uncertainty could delay crucial US macroeconomic data, leaving markets pessimistic. The first government shutdown under President Trump lasted for three days, while the second stretched 35 days, becoming the longest government shutdown in US history. However, John Glover, chief investment officer at Ledn, is optimistic about how markets will fare, stating, “While this was previously used as a way to force the holdouts in Congress to be more flexible in negotiations, it was largely seen both times as a very temporary situation, and risk markets, which initially sold off, bounced back quickly. The market will consider any dip in digital asset prices due to a shutdown as a buying opportunity.” Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion announced that its ETH treasury has crossed 2.65 million ETH tokens, worth $10.8 billion, following a series of acquisitions. The company recently purchased 234,846 ETH valued at $961.5 million, significantly expanding its market dominance. The firm’s total cash holdings crossed $11.6 billion as of September 28. It also holds 192 BTC, worth $21 million, a $157 million stake in WLD treasury firm Eightco, and $436 million in unencumbered cash reserves. BitMine aims to acquire 5% of ETH’s circulating supply, equalling 6.04 million tokens at current levels. ETH ended the previous weekend down almost 1% at $4,479. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 6% to $4,202, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $4,079. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH fell almost 1% to $4,166. The price registered a marginal drop on Wednesday before plunging nearly 7% on Thursday as bearish sentiment intensified. As a result, ETH fell below the crucial $4,000 mark and settled at $3,876. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH recovered on Friday, rising over 4% to reclaim $4,000 and settle at $4,014. The price registered a marginal drop on Saturday but regained momentum on Sunday, rising over 3% to settle at $4,144. Buyers retained control on Monday despite selling pressure as ETH rose almost 2% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,218. Despite the positive sentiment, the price fell nearly 2% on Tuesday and settled at $4,145. ETH has recovered during the ongoing session, up over 4% and trading around $4,317. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is up almost 4% as bullish sentiment returned after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $204. The altcoin has been on an upward trajectory since Friday, reaching $210 on Sunday. The price continued pushing higher on Saturday, reaching $212 before dropping over 2% to $208. The current session sees SOL at $216. Optimism around SOL has been rising after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted generic listing standards. The new listing standards have made the 19b-4 review clock irrelevant and shifted the approval process to S-1 registrations. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes a Solana ETF approval is a certainty. Balchunas stated on X, “Honestly, the odds are really 100% now. Generic listing standards make the 19b-4s and their ‘clock’ meaningless.” Before the change, 19b-4 filings triggered a statutory review clock, giving the SEC a fixed timeline of 240 days to approve or deny an ETF. However, that timeline has become approval after the approval of the “generic listing standards.” “That just leaves the S-1s waiting for formal green light from Corp Finance. And they just submitted amendment #4 for Solana. The baby could come any day. Be ready.” Jeffrey Ding, chief analyst at HashKey Group, believes a Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying, followed by a “sell the news” correction. “A Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying ahead of approval, followed by a potential ‘sell the news’ correction once launched—similar to what we saw with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.” SOL traded in bearish territory on Sunday (September 21), dropping 1.36%. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 7% to $220, but not before dropping to a low of $213. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as SOL fell over 3% and settled at $213. The price fell to an intraday low of $204 on Wednesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $211, ultimately falling 0.77%. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as SOL fell almost 9%, slipping below $200 and settling at $192. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, the price recovered on Friday, rising over 6% to reclaim $200 and settle at $205. Price action was mixed over the weekend, with SOL falling 0.83% on Saturday to $203. However, it was back in positive territory on Sunday, rising nearly 4% and settling at $210. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 1% to $212. Despite the positive sentiment, SOL was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping over 2% to $208. The price has increased by almost 4% during the current session, trading around $216. Celestia (TIA) Price Analysis Celestia (TIA) ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping over 2% to $1.683.

        "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-1-million-telegram-founder-durov/",
        "body": "Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of Telegram, used a wide-ranging conversation on the Lex Fridman Podcast to make one of his clearest long-term calls on Bitcoin yet: “I believe it will come to a point when Bitcoin is worth $1 million.” The remarks appear on Fridman’s newly released episode with Durov. Why Bitcoin Will Reach $1 Million: Pavel Durov Pressed by Fridman on why he kept accumulating Bitcoin and whether he sees further upside, Durov traced his conviction to the asset’s earliest days and to its monetary design. “I was a big believer in Bitcoin since more or less the start of it,” he said, recalling that he bought “my first few thousand of Bitcoin in 2013,” around “$700 per Bitcoin,” and refused to sell even as the price later fell toward $300. Related Reading: Will October Crown Bitcoin Or Break It? Key Levels In Play “And my response to them was, I don’t care. I’m not going to sell it. I believe in this thing.” For Durov, the crux is Bitcoin’s censorship resistance and predictable issuance: “Nobody can confiscate your Bitcoin from you. Nobody can censor you for political reasons. This is the ultimate means of exchange… The governments keep printing money like no tomorrow. Nobody’s printing Bitcoin. There is a predictable inflation and then it stops at a certain point. Bitcoin is here to stay.” Durov also drew a sharp line between his personal finances and Telegram’s operating economics, saying Bitcoin appreciation has effectively financed his lifestyle, not profits from the company. “Telegram is a money losing operation for me personally. Bitcoin is something that allowed me to stay afloat,” he noted, adding that his long-term horizon on the asset has not changed since his early purchases more than a decade ago. The timing of Durov’s $1 million thesis is notable given Telegram’s expanding role at crypto’s consumer edge. The company has progressively integrated the TON ecosystem into its product and business model, committing to Toncoin-based ad payments and revenue sharing for channel owners and opening its advertising platform to a broad set of markets. That TON-denominated ad infrastructure has been credited with catalyzing user and developer activity across Telegram’s mini-app economy. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders At Cost Basis: SOPR At 1 Signals Mareket Equilibrium On the wallet side, Telegram’s crypto functionality—first rolled out internationally—extended to the United States in July 2025, with the TON community’s wallet mini-app enabling in-app transfers and payments. The US expansion followed what Telegram described as nine-figure global wallet activation metrics in 2024, underscoring the scale of a potential distribution channel for on-chain payments and games. As for the $1 million number itself, Durov anchored it in supply discipline and fiat debasement rather than in short-term market catalysts. His reasoning tracks with hard-cap arguments long advanced by Bitcoin’s most committed holders: issuance is programmatic and terminal, while fiscal and monetary expansion remains discretionary.

Nobody is printing bitcoin.” 🚀 pic.twitter.com/AiDwr7xVkQ — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) September 30, 2025 Whether that macro narrative alone can deliver seven-figure prices is a market question; what Durov made clear is that his own positioning reflects a decade of conviction. “Just look at the trends,” he told Fridman. “Bitcoin is here to stay. All the fiat currencies remain to be seen.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $114,372. Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",

Acquisition aims to launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US. CoinShares will integrate Bastion’s systematic trading team and strategies to create alpha-focused products. Active crypto ETFs outnumbered passive funds in July 2025; CoinShares targets institutional demand for sophisticated strategies. CoinShares Bastion acquisition: CoinShares will launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US — learn what this means for investors and institutional demand. Read more. What is CoinShares acquiring Bastion Asset Management to do? CoinShares Bastion acquisition will combine Bastion’s systematic trading capabilities with CoinShares’ 1940 Act registration to develop actively managed crypto ETFs for US investors. The integration is designed to deliver strategies that seek alpha regardless of market direction, not just passive exposure to BTC or ETH. How will CoinShares launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US? CoinShares will fully integrate Bastion’s trading team, quantitative models, and execution systems into its platform pending UK FCA approval. As a registered investment adviser under the US Investment Company Act of 1940, CoinShares can structure actively managed products and list them in the US once regulatory and operational milestones are met. Key operational steps include: Regulatory clearance and integration of compliance frameworks. Technical and trading-system consolidation to support systematic strategies. Product design, testing, and filing with US exchanges using new streamlined listing standards. CoinShares is set to acquire investment manager Bastion Asset Management to launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US. European crypto asset manager CoinShares is set to make another strategic acquisition as the company prepares to go public in the United States. CoinShares announced Wednesday that it will acquire London-based crypto investment manager Bastion Asset Management as part of its strategy to expand crypto investment products in the US. The deal, pending approval from the UK Financial Conduct Authority, will see CoinShares fully integrate Bastion’s trading capabilities, strategies and team into its platform. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. “By combining Bastion’s systematic trading expertise with our 1940 Act registration, we can develop actively managed products for the US market that go beyond simple directional exposure to cryptocurrencies,” a CoinShares spokesperson told media sources. What is the difference between active ETFs and passive ETFs? Active ETFs are managed with a goal to outperform a benchmark through active selection and trading. Passive ETFs simply track an index or asset price. In crypto markets, most US offerings have been passive spot funds, while active strategies use discretionary or systematic selection to pursue returns. Passive ETFs versus active ETFs. Source: HANetf As CoinShares holds registered investment adviser status under the US Investment Company Act of 1940, the company is permitted to offer actively managed investment products in the US, including sophisticated strategies such as actively managed ETFs. However, creating these products requires deep quantitative expertise and proven systematic trading capabilities, which CoinShares expects to obtain from Bastion. “Bastion’s team has over 17 years of experience developing systematic, alpha-generating strategies at leading hedge funds including BlueCrest Capital, Systematica Investments, Rokos Capital, and GAM Systematic,” CoinShares noted in company comments. “Their quantitative approach, using academically-backed signals to generate returns independent of market direction, is precisely the type of sophisticated, actively managed strategy that differentiates managers in competitive markets.” Why are active crypto ETFs gaining traction now? The crypto ETF market has historically been dominated by passive spot Bitcoin and Ether funds. That trend shifted when active crypto ETFs outnumbered index-tracking funds in July 2025, reflecting greater demand for advanced strategies. Regulatory changes in the US that allow faster listing processes for new crypto funds have also accelerated product launches. Industry reporting indicates a shortened maximum filing-to-launch window — from 240 days to as little as 75 days under new exchange rules — making active product launches more feasible. Actively managed ETFs outnumbered passive funds in July 2025. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence How does CoinShares’ planned US listing affect this strategy? CoinShares plans a US public listing via a special purpose acquisition company at a reported $1.2 billion pre-money equity valuation. The listing is intended to increase access to US capital and institutional distribution channels. “The US remains the world’s deepest capital market for digital assets, and we’re building the infrastructure, team, and product suite to become a leading institutional player in that market,” CoinShares said in company remarks. Frequently Asked Questions Will CoinShares offer both passive and actively managed crypto ETFs? Yes. CoinShares intends to offer directional (passive-like) products and actively managed strategies designed to generate alpha regardless of market conditions, leveraging Bastion’s systematic models. When will CoinShares’ actively managed ETFs be available in the US? Timing depends on regulatory approval, integration milestones, and exchange listing processes. CoinShares must complete UK FCA approvals and US product filings before launch; expedited exchange processes may shorten timelines. What experience does Bastion bring to CoinShares? Bastion’s team has over 17 years of experience building systematic strategies at major hedge funds. That expertise is central to CoinShares’ plan to build quantitative, academically-backed signals for crypto ETFs. Key Takeaways Strategic acquisition : CoinShares is acquiring Bastion to add systematic trading and quantitative expertise. Product innovation : The goal is to launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US that pursue alpha, not just market exposure. Market timing : Regulatory changes and increasing demand for active strategies create a favorable window for launches. Conclusion CoinShares’ acquisition of Bastion Asset Management positions the firm to bring actively managed crypto ETFs to the US market, combining regulatory capability and deep quantitative expertise. Investors and institutions should watch for regulatory clearances and product filings as CoinShares executes its US listing and product rollout plans. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"CoinShares acquires Bastion to build actively managed crypto ETFs in the US\", \"description\": \"CoinShares is acquiring Bastion Asset Management to launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US, using Bastion's systematic trading and CoinShares' 1940 Act registration.\", \"image\": [ \"https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01999f4d-4670-7f97-9f06-6a819b524671.png\" ], \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-01T08:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-01T08:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png\" } }, \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com\" }} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"What is CoinShares acquiring Bastion Asset Management to do?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"CoinShares will integrate Bastion’s systematic trading team and models to develop actively managed crypto ETFs for the US, leveraging its 1940 Act registration to offer alpha-seeking strategies.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How will CoinShares launch actively managed crypto ETFs in the US?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"CoinShares will complete regulatory approvals, integrate Bastion’s trading infrastructure, design products, and file with US exchanges under new streamlined listing standards.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"When might these actively managed ETFs be available?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Availability depends on UK FCA approval, US filing and listing timelines; expedited exchange procedures may reduce time from filing to launch.\" } } ]} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How CoinShares will bring actively managed crypto ETFs to the US\", \"description\": \"High-level plan for integrating Bastion and launching actively managed ETFs.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"position\": 1, \"name\": \"Secure regulatory approvals\", \"text\": \"Obtain UK FCA approval for the acquisition and confirm compliance with US 1940 Act requirements.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"position\": 2, \"name\": \"Integrate technology and team\", \"text\": \"Combine Bastion’s systematic trading models, data pipelines, and execution systems with CoinShares’ product infrastructure.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"position\": 3, \"name\": \"Design and file products\", \"text\": \"Develop actively managed ETF strategies, run operational tests, and file listing applications with US exchanges.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"position\": 4, \"name\": \"List and distribute\", \"text\": \"List the ETFs on US exchanges, launch marketing to institutional channels, and monitor performance and compliance.\" } ], \"totalTime\": \"P3M\"}",

        "body": "La ripresa di Ethereum si è rafforzata dopo che gli ETF spot su ETH negli Stati Uniti hanno registrato 547 milioni di dollari di afflussi netti in un solo giorno , ponendo fine a una serie negativa di cinque giorni consecutivi di deflussi. A guidare la giornata è stato il Fidelity FETH con 202 milioni di dollari, seguito dal BlackRock ETHA con 154 milioni di dollari. Attualmente, gli ETF su ETH gestiscono circa 27,5 miliardi di dollari, pari a circa il 5,4% della capitalizzazione di mercato circolante, un dato che segnala un rinnovato interesse istituzionale mentre il prezzo ha riconquistato il livello psicologico dei 4.000 dollari. Smart Money accumula Ethereum (ETH) mentre le riserve calano Dal punto di vista dei bilanci societari, le istituzioni continuano ad aumentare la loro esposizione. BitMine Immersion Technologies ha rivelato di detenere un tesoro aziendale di 2,65 milioni di ETH, il più grande tracciato tra i suoi pari, mentre Bit Digital prevede di raccogliere 100 milioni di dollari tramite una nota convertibile per acquisire ulteriore ETH, con la possibilità di scalare la classifica delle tesorerie più ricche. Sul fronte on-chain, i dati di CryptoQuant mostrano un calo delle riserve sugli exchange, segnale coerente con il trasferimento delle monete verso la custodia e lo staking: condizioni che storicamente riducono l’offerta circolante quando la domanda cresce. Previsioni Prezzo Ethereum: obiettivi a 4.500–5.000 $ Dal punto di vista tecnico, ETH ha registrato un rialzo di circa +250% dai minimi di ciclo. Alcuni analisti, come Ted Pillows, ritengono che una breve correzione potrebbe preparare il terreno per un movimento verso i 4.500–5.000 dollari, con la possibilità di raggiungere anche i 10.000 dollari in caso di condizioni macro e di liquidità favorevoli. Nel breve termine, mantenere chiusure sopra i 4.200–4.250 dollari manterrebbe i rialzisti in controllo; in caso contrario, il rischio è di una discesa verso l’area di supporto tra 3.800–3.600 dollari. Le integrazioni con la finanza tradizionale rafforzano Ethereum Oltre agli afflussi e alle tesorerie, progrediscono anche le integrazioni nel mondo TradFi. SWIFT ha testato la Layer-2 Linea di Ethereum insieme a BNP Paribas e BNY Mellon per la messaggistica di regolamento on-chain, mentre un progetto più ampio tra SWIFT e Consensys sta esplorando un registro blockchain per i pagamenti transfrontalieri 24/7. Se anche solo una piccola parte del volume di SWIFT si spostasse on-chain, potrebbe diventare un motore costante di domanda per lo spazio dei blocchi e per lo staking di ETH. Conclusione Afflussi record negli ETF, riduzione delle riserve sugli exchange e nuovi progetti con la finanza tradizionale rafforzano lo scenario rialzista di Ethereum sopra i 4.000 dollari. Sopra i 4.200 dollari, il percorso si apre verso i 4.500–5.000 dollari. Sotto tale livello, è probabile un sano retest nella fascia alta dei 3.000 dollari prima della prossima gamba rialzista. Per ora, le evidenze pendono dalla parte dei tori.",

XRP is down over 1%, while SOL is marginally up, trading around $209. DOGE traded around $0.233, while Cardano (ADA) is up 1.35%, trading around $0.805. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. However, Toncoin (TON) and Litecoin (LTC) bucked the bearish trend to register marginal increases. CZ Warns BNB Chain’s Official Account May Be Compromised Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has warned that the official X account of BNB Chain could be compromised. The breach came to light after the official account posted a suspicious link promoting a fake BSC rewards program. Zhao stated on his official account, “The BNB Chain X account may have been compromised. Please do not click on any links recently posted from this account. The teams are investigating and will share updates as soon as possible.” The suspicious post on the BNB Chain account urged users to vote on an upcoming BSC rewards site and claimed early rewards would be given to participants within 24 hours. The message included a phishing link to steal unsuspecting users’ digital assets and private data. The warning comes after Zhao said earlier that the BNB Chain account may have been compromised. Binance is yet to issue an official statement. Ripple, Coinbase, And BitGo Could Qualify As Custodians The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cleared the path for Ripple, BitGo, and Coinbase to become custodians for crypto assets. The regulator’s Division of Investment Management issued a no-action letter on September 30 in response to a request from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. The SEC’s latest guidance allows investment advisers to use state-chartered trust companies as custodians under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The letter implies the SEC will not pursue enforcement action if advisers follow the conditions outlined. To qualify as a custodian, state-chartered trusts must be governed by a US state banking authority like the Department of Financial Services in New York or the Division of Banking in South Dakota. The trusts must also provide independent control reports, audited financial statements that comply with GAAP, and custodial agreements forbidding the rehypothecation of client assets without their consent. It also outlines additional safeguards, including keeping client assets off the custodian’s balance sheet and periodic due diligence checks, including surprise audits. Trump Withdraws Brian Quintenz’s CFTC Nomination The Trump administration has withdrawn Brian Quintenz’s nomination as the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Quintenz confirmed the withdrawal, stating, “Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life. I am grateful to the president for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I look forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country.” The crypto industry vehemently backed Quintenz. However, his nomination was held up in Congress amid reported pushback from Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Quintenz had claimed the Winklevoss twins had interfered with his nomination and pressured President Donald Trump to drop his nomination. He also shared a series of texts between him and the Winklevoss twins on X, claiming Trump was being misled. Quintenz said at the time, “I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise. It’s my understanding that after this exchange, they contacted the president and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has bounced back to reclaim $115,000 after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $112,695. The flagship cryptocurrency rose by over 2% on Sunday to $112,000. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% and settled at $114,365. However, selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $112,695 before settling at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal drop. BTC is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,012. BTC’s start to October aligns with predictions that the bull market will resume in October. BTC and the broader cryptocurrency market suffered a substantial drop in September, with the flagship cryptocurrency falling to a low of $109,623 on September 25. Additionally, gold and traditional markets have posted record highs, and analysts expect BTC to catch up sooner rather than later. One analyst stated, “Bitcoin tends to follow gold, 3-4 months down the line. $BTC began to mimic gold’s ‘rise → pause → last minute spike’ pattern. If the correlation holds, $BTC is now ready for a last-minute spike through October/November, breaking out of its rising wedge.” According to 50TFunds CEO Dan Tapiero, Bitcoin’s October bull market is yet to begin. “Wake up. The bull market in Bitcoin has not started yet. Same price in gold terms as 5 years ago. Massive cup and handle leads to new upside price discovery. 4% short rates too high, Usd bear now, DC reg wind at back, Dats, Etfs, Stables, Defi, Rwas etc New world.” However, pro traders remain jittery about holding downside risks despite BTC’s recovery. This is because the derivatives markets show heightened fear. Investors are considering whether the metrics reflect market concerns or whether they are specific to the cryptocurrency market. BTC’s skew metric reached 5% on Tuesday before eventually returning to 8%, indicating a higher premium for put options. BTC’s skew metric generally ranges between -6% and 6% under normal conditions. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.41% to $115,282 on Sunday. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell by over 2% to $112,736. Sellers retained control on Tuesday with BTC falling 0.64% to a low of $111,502 before settling at $112,017. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 1% to reclaim $113,000 and settling at $113,348. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment returned on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, rising 0.61% but was back in the red on Saturday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $109,681. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $112,000 and settle at $112,197. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,365. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC fell to a low of $112,695 on Tuesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal decline. The price is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,209. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has bounced back during the ongoing session after falling to a low of $4,094 on Tuesday. The altcoin faced substantial selling pressure last week, but has made an equally strong recovery to reclaim key levels. It started the week positively, rising over 3% on Sunday and 1.78% on Monday to settle at $4,218. The price fell almost 2% on Tuesday before recovering and crossing $4,300 during the ongoing session. ETH has held firm despite the US government shutdown. The political uncertainty could delay crucial US macroeconomic data, leaving markets pessimistic. The first government shutdown under President Trump lasted for three days, while the second stretched 35 days, becoming the longest government shutdown in US history. However, John Glover, chief investment officer at Ledn, is optimistic about how markets will fare, stating, “While this was previously used as a way to force the holdouts in Congress to be more flexible in negotiations, it was largely seen both times as a very temporary situation, and risk markets, which initially sold off, bounced back quickly. The market will consider any dip in digital asset prices due to a shutdown as a buying opportunity.” Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion announced that its ETH treasury has crossed 2.65 million ETH tokens, worth $10.8 billion, following a series of acquisitions. The company recently purchased 234,846 ETH valued at $961.5 million, significantly expanding its market dominance. The firm’s total cash holdings crossed $11.6 billion as of September 28. It also holds 192 BTC, worth $21 million, a $157 million stake in WLD treasury firm Eightco, and $436 million in unencumbered cash reserves. BitMine aims to acquire 5% of ETH’s circulating supply, equalling 6.04 million tokens at current levels. ETH ended the previous weekend down almost 1% at $4,479. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 6% to $4,202, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $4,079. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH fell almost 1% to $4,166. The price registered a marginal drop on Wednesday before plunging nearly 7% on Thursday as bearish sentiment intensified. As a result, ETH fell below the crucial $4,000 mark and settled at $3,876. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH recovered on Friday, rising over 4% to reclaim $4,000 and settle at $4,014. The price registered a marginal drop on Saturday but regained momentum on Sunday, rising over 3% to settle at $4,144. Buyers retained control on Monday despite selling pressure as ETH rose almost 2% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,218. Despite the positive sentiment, the price fell nearly 2% on Tuesday and settled at $4,145. ETH has recovered during the ongoing session, up over 4% and trading around $4,317. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is up almost 4% as bullish sentiment returned after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $204. The altcoin has been on an upward trajectory since Friday, reaching $210 on Sunday. The price continued pushing higher on Saturday, reaching $212 before dropping over 2% to $208. The current session sees SOL at $216. Optimism around SOL has been rising after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted generic listing standards. The new listing standards have made the 19b-4 review clock irrelevant and shifted the approval process to S-1 registrations. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes a Solana ETF approval is a certainty. Balchunas stated on X, “Honestly, the odds are really 100% now. Generic listing standards make the 19b-4s and their ‘clock’ meaningless.” Before the change, 19b-4 filings triggered a statutory review clock, giving the SEC a fixed timeline of 240 days to approve or deny an ETF. However, that timeline has become approval after the approval of the “generic listing standards.” “That just leaves the S-1s waiting for formal green light from Corp Finance. And they just submitted amendment #4 for Solana. The baby could come any day. Be ready.” Jeffrey Ding, chief analyst at HashKey Group, believes a Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying, followed by a “sell the news” correction. “A Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying ahead of approval, followed by a potential ‘sell the news’ correction once launched—similar to what we saw with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.” SOL traded in bearish territory on Sunday (September 21), dropping 1.36%. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 7% to $220, but not before dropping to a low of $213. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as SOL fell over 3% and settled at $213.

        "url": "https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/01/crypto-markets-today-market-rallies-altcoins-lead-gains-zcash-hits-16-month-high",
        "body": "The crypto market experienced a boost on Wednesday with majors bitcoin BTC and ether ETH rising 2.9% and 3.1% respectively. But the real story was in the altcoin market as several tokens rose by double-digits as investors speculate on another phase of \"atlcoin season.\" ZEC hit its highest point since May 2022 while a number of DeFi tokens also experienced moves to the upside. The market uptick comes alongside a backdrop of the U.S. government shutdown, which has spurred gold prices to record highs and caused a sell-off in the dollar. Derivatives Positioning by Jacob Joseph The BTC futures market continues to show a strengthening bullish bias. The overall futures open interest remains high at around $31.69 billion, reflecting sustained trader engagement, with Binance still leading the pack at $13.19 billion. Concurrently, the 3-month annualized basis is holding firm between 6% and 7%, indicating that the yield from the basis trade remains robust. This consistent metric across both open interest and basis suggests that traders are not only increasing their exposure but are doing so with conviction, reinforcing the positive sentiment observed in the market. The BTC options market continues to show a divergence between its key metrics, presenting a complex picture of market sentiment. While the 25 Delta Skew for short-term options remains low, suggesting that traders are still willing to pay a premium for puts to hedge against downside risk, the 24-hour Put/Call Volume points to a surge in bullish speculation. The latest data shows that calls now make up 63.54% of the total volume, a strong reversal from a put-dominated market. This conflicting data indicates a highly polarized environment where some traders are hedging against potential price drops, while a larger number are actively betting on a short-term rally. Funding rates have not only remained positive on major exchanges like Binance and OKX, but have picked up across the board, including on the historically volatile Hyperliquid. Deribit, in particular, is seeing a significant premium, with its annualized funding rate jumping to 17%. This indicates a strong and sustained demand for leveraged long positions, as traders are consistently willing to pay a high premium to hold their bullish bets. The widespread positive funding across all major platforms signals a collective market conviction in a continued upward trend for BTC. Coinglass data shows $644 million in 24 hour liquidations, with a 38-62 split between longs and shorts. BTC ($166 million), ETH ($164 million) and Others ($69 million) were the leaders in terms of notional liquidations. Binance liquidation heatmap indicates $116,650 as a core liquidation level to monitor, in case of a price rise. Token Talk By Oliver Knight Privacy token zcash (ZEC) is leading the pack on Wednesday, rising to its highest point since May 2022 following a break out against its bitcoin and dollar trading pairs. ZEC touched $97.25 before retreating back to around $92.00 - a 41% rise for the day on the back of a 36% rise in daily trading volume to $300 million. The surge comes alongside a boost across the wider altcoin market, with DeFi tokens ethena (ENA), curve (CRV) and raydium (RAY) all increasing by more than 8%. A number of catalysts triggered the crypto recovery; notably the U.S. government shutdown that brought the dollar lower and gold to fresh record highs at $3,887. Altcoins have outperformed bitcoin so far on Wednesday, although it's worth noting that the average crypto relative strength index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory, suggesting that a period of consolidation is on the cards as the market begins to cool. One market outlier was aster, the native token of its namesake's BNB Chain-based perpetual exchange. ASTER slumped by 6.8% on Wednesday to compound a 25% decline over the past week as hype in the HyperLiquid rival begins to fade.",

        "body": "Bitcoin Q4 outlook: The market rebound is being driven by ETF inflows, a dovish U.S. Federal Reserve stance, and historical Q4 seasonality. These forces lifted Bitcoin above $116,000 and reduced downside protection demand, signaling growing institutional confidence and a materially improved probability of further gains this quarter. ETF inflows and institutional positioning are the primary bullish drivers. Short liquidations and options skew contraction show reduced downside hedging. Bitcoin surged past $116,000; total crypto market cap reached $4.09 trillion on October 1. Bitcoin Q4 outlook: ETF flows, dovish Fed, and Q4 seasonality lifted BTC to $116K. Read expert analysis and market signals now. What is driving the Bitcoin Q4 outlook? Bitcoin Q4 outlook is shaped by sustained ETF demand, a dovish Federal Reserve outlook, and persistent Q4 seasonality. These factors lifted BTC above $116,000 and increased market-wide capitalization, while options and liquidation metrics point to lower downside hedging and heightened bullish sentiment. How did today’s rally unfold and what were the key data points? On Wednesday morning, Bitcoin surged past $116,000, erasing much of September’s losses and pushing total crypto market capitalization to $4.09 trillion. At publication time, Bitcoin was trading near $116,441, up approximately 3.1% on the day, per CoinGecko data. Short liquidations during the London session wiped out roughly $60 million in short bets, according to Coinalyze data. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Bitcoin Q4 outlook: ETF demand, dovish Fed and Q4 seasonality lift BTC past $116K\", \"description\": \"Bitcoin Q4 outlook improved as ETF inflows, dovish Fed signals and historical Q4 strength pushed BTC above $116,000, reducing demand for downside protection.\", \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-01T08:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-01T08:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"name\": \"Bitcoin Q4 outlook\" }} Why do options skew and dominance metrics matter for the outlook? Options data shows a roughly 55% decline in Bitcoin’s 25-delta skew, indicating reduced demand for downside protection. Glassnode’s note on Bitcoin dominance rising from 57% to 59% after breaking $114,000 signals a healthier market structure and suggests rallies led by Bitcoin tend to be more durable than altcoin-led moves. Frequently Asked Questions Will ETF flows keep supporting Bitcoin in Q4? ETF flows have been a consistent demand source; continued inflows would likely sustain upward pressure. Institutional positioning and ETF activity are cited by market analysts as core drivers of the current bullish setup. How likely is a sustained Q4 rally for Bitcoin? Historical seasonality shows strong Q4 performance: over the past 12 years, Q4 delivered a median gain of more than 50% for Bitcoin, per Coinglass data. Combined with current market signals, the probability of a bullish Q4 has increased. What short-term risks should traders monitor? Watch for reversal in ETF flows, sudden macro surprises, or a shift in Fed commentary. Persistent concentration in Bitcoin dominance and elevated leverage can amplify corrections despite bullish indicators. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Will ETF flows keep supporting Bitcoin in Q4?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"ETF flows have become a main source of structural demand; continued inflows would likely sustain upward pressure on Bitcoin in Q4.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How likely is a sustained Q4 rally for Bitcoin?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Historical Q4 seasonality and current market signals increase the likelihood of a bullish Q4, with past median gains exceeding 50% over 12 years.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"What short-term risks should traders monitor?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Monitor ETF flow reversals, macro data surprises, Fed commentary shifts, and concentrated leverage that can trigger sharp corrections.\" } } ]} How should traders interpret the current market signals? Traders should view ETF inflows, options skew contraction, and rising Bitcoin dominance as converging bullish signals. Experts quoted include Shawn Young, MEXC chief analyst, and Derek Lim, head of research at Caladan, who note structural demand and improving macro positioning are supportive for Q4. Key Takeaways ETF demand drives structural buying : Sustained ETF flows are a core bullish engine for Bitcoin. Market structure improved : Bitcoin dominance recovery and fewer downside hedges point to healthier breadth. Seasonality and macro align : Historical Q4 strength plus a dovish Fed increase probability of continued gains; monitor ETF flows and macro data. How to act on the Bitcoin Q4 outlook? For traders and institutions: align position sizing with risk tolerance, use options to hedge selectively, and monitor ETF inflows and macro headlines. For longer-term investors: consider dollar-cost averaging to manage entry risk during volatile rallies. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to interpret Bitcoin Q4 signals\", \"description\": \"Steps to assess Bitcoin Q4 outlook using ETF flows, options skew, dominance metrics, and macro indicators.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Review ETF flows\", \"text\": \"Track net inflows to ETFs and institutional products to gauge structural demand.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Check options skew and liquidations\", \"text\": \"Lower skew and reduced short liquidations indicate declining downside hedging.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Monitor Bitcoin dominance and market cap\", \"text\": \"Rising dominance can signal more durable, Bitcoin-led rallies.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Watch macro and Fed signals\", \"text\": \"A dovish Fed and muted macro releases can increase risk appetite toward crypto.\" } ]} Conclusion The Bitcoin Q4 outlook has improved as ETF demand, a dovish Fed backdrop, and historical Q4 seasonality combine to push Bitcoin above $116,000.

        "body": "Robert Kiyosaki, the renowned author behind the bestselling personal finance book “Rich Dad, Poor Dad,” has taken to X to express his distaste for Warren Buffett’s recent change of heart. For years, the 95-year-old chairman of Berkshire Hathaway has criticized metals like gold and silver as unproductive assets. According to him, these commodities do not generate income. Kiyosaki noted that the American businessman has suddenly switched to praising “the virtues of gold and silver,” an act the author says makes him “want to vomit.” Depression Ahead? Buffett is a long-time supporter of stocks and bonds. He has particularly touted stocks as being a better investment than cash or bonds. However, with his recent attention on gold and silver, Kiyosaki projects that the stock and bond markets could crash soon. “Even though Buffet shit on gold and silver investors like me for years, his sickening endorsement of gold and silver must mean stocks and bonds are about to crash,” he said. Some of Kiyosaki’s followers stress that Buffett’s action is probably a way of redeploying the $344 billion cash pile that Berkshire Hathaway is currently holding. Kiyosaki Advocates for Metals and Crypto Ending his tweet, Kiyosaki emphasized that he would take Buffett’s advice and buy gold and silver. He added that he would accumulate bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). Notably, the renowned author rarely mentions ETH among his investment choices. Adding Ether to his list this time shows that he is bullish on the recent performance of the second-largest crypto. Buffett, on the other hand, has long been opposed to cryptocurrencies. He has even called Bitcoin a “rat poison squared” and a gambling token. Notwithstanding, he has invested in stocks linked to cryptocurrencies. With the 95-year-old businessman changing his view on gold and silver, some onlookers speculate that he might do the same with Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/blackrock-files-bitcoin-premium-income-etf/",
        "body": "Nasdaq has formally submitted a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the listing and trading of the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF. The proposed fund comes under the commodity-based trust rule, according to the September 30 submission. The SEC recognized that the filing complies with the general listing criteria and initiated a public comment period on the proposed rule change. If approved, the product will add to BlackRock’s expanding lineup of investment products linked to Bitcoin, which builds on the success of its widely traded iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The new fund includes a covered call mechanism that will generate a consistent yield through Bitcoin exposure, alleviating the need for income-oriented investors for pure spot price exposure. How the Premium Income ETF differs from IBIT While IBIT tracks the spot price of Bitcoin, the Premium Income ETF adds an options overlay to extract extra income. According to the filing, the trust will invest mainly in Bitcoin, IBIT shares, and cash reserves. It will also generate yield through call options writing on IBIT or indices tracking for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described the strategy as a “sequel” to IBIT, pointing out that it is not intended to diversify into other digital assets but rather to broaden income-generating opportunities within Bitcoin exposure. The fund may also contain FLEX derivatives traded on the regulated exchanges to optimize its strategy. The ETF aims at attracting investors who would like to invest in digital assets, but with lower volatility and fixed yields. It helps them access direct Bitcoin holdings alongside systematic option writing. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust has also hit an important milestone in the derivatives market. The rise of IBIT options to become the largest venue for Bitcoin options trading has shown the increasing influence that Wall Street plays in the cryptocurrency space. According to Bloomberg, the open interest of IBIT-linked options as of Friday’s expiration was almost $38 billion, a volume exceeding the $32 billion recorded on Deribit. It occurred less than a year after the launch of IBIT options in November 2024, resulting in IBIT’s entire market share being cut since its inception in 2016. According to Bloomberg, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has surpassed Coinbase’s Deribit platform to become the largest venue for Bitcoin options trading. Following last Friday’s contract expirations, open interest in options tied to the Nasdaq-listed IBIT reached nearly… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 30, 2025 BlackRock continues to accumulate Bitcoin and Ether The Nasdaq filing came with new blockchain data indicating heavy crypto inflows into BlackRock’s existing ETFs. Whale Insider reported that the firm recently purchased over $199 million USD of Bitcoin using its IBIT vehicle. The purchase added more than 794 BTC, done in structured batches of approximately 100 coins each. The transactions were conducted in Coinbase Prime hot wallets and settled directly into addresses associated with BlackRock’s IBIT ETF. Analysts said that the planned structure of the trades was indicative of a plan to minimize disruption to the market while preserving liquidity. Along with Bitcoin, BlackRock also increased its exposure to Ethereum. Data shows that the firm bought 6,901 ETH worth $28.44 million and then another 10,000 ETH worth $41.21 million via its ETHA Ethereum ETF. The combined inflows illustrate a dual asset approach between the two largest digital assets. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter. It's free .",

        "body": "The cryptocurrency market registered a marginal decline over the past 24 hours as prominent altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) , Ripple (XRP) , and Solana (SOL), fell into bearish territory. However, Bitcoin (BTC) defied bearish trends and is up nearly 1%, trading around $114,542. The flagship cryptocurrency traded around $112,874 on Tuesday but recovered from this level to start October in positive territory. BTC reached an intraday high of $114,744 before moving to its current level of $114,506. Meanwhile, ETH is struggling to regain momentum, with selling pressure pushing it back into the red. The altcoin briefly crossed $4,200 but lost momentum after reaching this level and moved to its current level of $4,142, down almost 1%. XRP is down over 1%, while SOL is marginally up, trading around $209. DOGE traded around $0.233, while Cardano (ADA) is up 1.35%, trading around $0.805. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. However, Toncoin (TON) and Litecoin (LTC) bucked the bearish trend to register marginal increases. CZ Warns BNB Chain’s Official Account May Be Compromised Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has warned that the official X account of BNB Chain could be compromised. The breach came to light after the official account posted a suspicious link promoting a fake BSC rewards program. Zhao stated on his official account, “The BNB Chain X account may have been compromised. Please do not click on any links recently posted from this account. The teams are investigating and will share updates as soon as possible.” The suspicious post on the BNB Chain account urged users to vote on an upcoming BSC rewards site and claimed early rewards would be given to participants within 24 hours. The message included a phishing link to steal unsuspecting users’ digital assets and private data. The warning comes after Zhao said earlier that the BNB Chain account may have been compromised. Binance is yet to issue an official statement. Ripple, Coinbase, And BitGo Could Qualify As Custodians The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cleared the path for Ripple, BitGo, and Coinbase to become custodians for crypto assets. The regulator’s Division of Investment Management issued a no-action letter on September 30 in response to a request from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. The SEC’s latest guidance allows investment advisers to use state-chartered trust companies as custodians under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The letter implies the SEC will not pursue enforcement action if advisers follow the conditions outlined. To qualify as a custodian, state-chartered trusts must be governed by a US state banking authority like the Department of Financial Services in New York or the Division of Banking in South Dakota. The trusts must also provide independent control reports, audited financial statements that comply with GAAP, and custodial agreements forbidding the rehypothecation of client assets without their consent. It also outlines additional safeguards, including keeping client assets off the custodian’s balance sheet and periodic due diligence checks, including surprise audits. Trump Withdraws Brian Quintenz’s CFTC Nomination The Trump administration has withdrawn Brian Quintenz’s nomination as the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Quintenz confirmed the withdrawal, stating, “Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life. I am grateful to the president for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I look forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country.” The crypto industry vehemently backed Quintenz. However, his nomination was held up in Congress amid reported pushback from Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Quintenz had claimed the Winklevoss twins had interfered with his nomination and pressured President Donald Trump to drop his nomination. He also shared a series of texts between him and the Winklevoss twins on X, claiming Trump was being misled. Quintenz said at the time, “I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise. It’s my understanding that after this exchange, they contacted the president and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has bounced back to reclaim $115,000 after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $112,695. The flagship cryptocurrency rose by over 2% on Sunday to $112,000. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% and settled at $114,365. However, selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $112,695 before settling at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal drop. BTC is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,012. BTC’s start to October aligns with predictions that the bull market will resume in October. BTC and the broader cryptocurrency market suffered a substantial drop in September, with the flagship cryptocurrency falling to a low of $109,623 on September 25. Additionally, gold and traditional markets have posted record highs, and analysts expect BTC to catch up sooner rather than later. One analyst stated, “Bitcoin tends to follow gold, 3-4 months down the line. $BTC began to mimic gold’s ‘rise → pause → last minute spike’ pattern. If the correlation holds, $BTC is now ready for a last-minute spike through October/November, breaking out of its rising wedge.” According to 50TFunds CEO Dan Tapiero, Bitcoin’s October bull market is yet to begin. “Wake up. The bull market in Bitcoin has not started yet. Same price in gold terms as 5 years ago. Massive cup and handle leads to new upside price discovery. 4% short rates too high, Usd bear now, DC reg wind at back, Dats, Etfs, Stables, Defi, Rwas etc New world.” However, pro traders remain jittery about holding downside risks despite BTC’s recovery. This is because the derivatives markets show heightened fear. Investors are considering whether the metrics reflect market concerns or whether they are specific to the cryptocurrency market. BTC’s skew metric reached 5% on Tuesday before eventually returning to 8%, indicating a higher premium for put options. BTC’s skew metric generally ranges between -6% and 6% under normal conditions. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.41% to $115,282 on Sunday. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell by over 2% to $112,736. Sellers retained control on Tuesday with BTC falling 0.64% to a low of $111,502 before settling at $112,017. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 1% to reclaim $113,000 and settling at $113,348. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment returned on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, rising 0.61% but was back in the red on Saturday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $109,681. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $112,000 and settle at $112,197. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,365. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC fell to a low of $112,695 on Tuesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal decline. The price is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,209. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has bounced back during the ongoing session after falling to a low of $4,094 on Tuesday. The altcoin faced substantial selling pressure last week, but has made an equally strong recovery to reclaim key levels. It started the week positively, rising over 3% on Sunday and 1.78% on Monday to settle at $4,218. The price fell almost 2% on Tuesday before recovering and crossing $4,300 during the ongoing session. ETH has held firm despite the US government shutdown. The political uncertainty could delay crucial US macroeconomic data, leaving markets pessimistic. The first government shutdown under President Trump lasted for three days, while the second stretched 35 days, becoming the longest government shutdown in US history. However, John Glover, chief investment officer at Ledn, is optimistic about how markets will fare, stating, “While this was previously used as a way to force the holdouts in Congress to be more flexible in negotiations, it was largely seen both times as a very temporary situation, and risk markets, which initially sold off, bounced back quickly. The market will consider any dip in digital asset prices due to a shutdown as a buying opportunity.” Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion announced that its ETH treasury has crossed 2.65 million ETH tokens, worth $10.8 billion, following a series of acquisitions. The company recently purchased 234,846 ETH valued at $961.5 million, significantly expanding its market dominance. The firm’s total cash holdings crossed $11.6 billion as of September 28. It also holds 192 BTC, worth $21 million, a $157 million stake in WLD treasury firm Eightco, and $436 million in unencumbered cash reserves. BitMine aims to acquire 5% of ETH’s circulating supply, equalling 6.04 million tokens at current levels. ETH ended the previous weekend down almost 1% at $4,479. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 6% to $4,202, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $4,079. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH fell almost 1% to $4,166. The price registered a marginal drop on Wednesday before plunging nearly 7% on Thursday as bearish sentiment intensified. As a result, ETH fell below the crucial $4,000 mark and settled at $3,876. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH recovered on Friday, rising over 4% to reclaim $4,000 and settle at $4,014. The price registered a marginal drop on Saturday but regained momentum on Sunday, rising over 3% to settle at $4,144. Buyers retained control on Monday despite selling pressure as ETH rose almost 2% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,218. Despite the positive sentiment, the price fell nearly 2% on Tuesday and settled at $4,145. ETH has recovered during the ongoing session, up over 4% and trading around $4,317. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is up almost 4% as bullish sentiment returned after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $204. The altcoin has been on an upward trajectory since Friday, reaching $210 on Sunday. The price continued pushing higher on Saturday, reaching $212 before dropping over 2% to $208. The current session sees SOL at $216. Optimism around SOL has been rising after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted generic listing standards. The new listing standards have made the 19b-4 review clock irrelevant and shifted the approval process to S-1 registrations. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes a Solana ETF approval is a certainty. Balchunas stated on X, “Honestly, the odds are really 100% now. Generic listing standards make the 19b-4s and their ‘clock’ meaningless.” Before the change, 19b-4 filings triggered a statutory review clock, giving the SEC a fixed timeline of 240 days to approve or deny an ETF. However, that timeline has become approval after the approval of the “generic listing standards.” “That just leaves the S-1s waiting for formal green light from Corp Finance. And they just submitted amendment #4 for Solana. The baby could come any day. Be ready.” Jeffrey Ding, chief analyst at HashKey Group, believes a Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying, followed by a “sell the news” correction. “A Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying ahead of approval, followed by a potential ‘sell the news’ correction once launched—similar to what we saw with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.” SOL traded in bearish territory on Sunday (September 21), dropping 1.36%. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 7% to $220, but not before dropping to a low of $213. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as SOL fell over 3% and settled at $213.

        "body": "The cryptocurrency market registered a marginal decline over the past 24 hours as prominent altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) , Ripple (XRP) , and Solana (SOL), fell into bearish territory. However, Bitcoin (BTC) defied bearish trends and is up nearly 1%, trading around $114,542. The flagship cryptocurrency traded around $112,874 on Tuesday but recovered from this level to start October in positive territory. BTC reached an intraday high of $114,744 before moving to its current level of $114,506. Meanwhile, ETH is struggling to regain momentum, with selling pressure pushing it back into the red. The altcoin briefly crossed $4,200 but lost momentum after reaching this level and moved to its current level of $4,142, down almost 1%. XRP is down over 1%, while SOL is marginally up, trading around $209. DOGE traded around $0.233, while Cardano (ADA) is up 1.35%, trading around $0.805. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines.

CZ Warns BNB Chain’s Official Account May Be Compromised Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has warned that the official X account of BNB Chain could be compromised. The breach came to light after the official account posted a suspicious link promoting a fake BSC rewards program. Zhao stated on his official account, “The BNB Chain X account may have been compromised. Please do not click on any links recently posted from this account. The teams are investigating and will share updates as soon as possible.” The suspicious post on the BNB Chain account urged users to vote on an upcoming BSC rewards site and claimed early rewards would be given to participants within 24 hours. The message included a phishing link to steal unsuspecting users’ digital assets and private data. The warning comes after Zhao said earlier that the BNB Chain account may have been compromised. Binance is yet to issue an official statement. Ripple, Coinbase, And BitGo Could Qualify As Custodians The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cleared the path for Ripple, BitGo, and Coinbase to become custodians for crypto assets. The regulator’s Division of Investment Management issued a no-action letter on September 30 in response to a request from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. The SEC’s latest guidance allows investment advisers to use state-chartered trust companies as custodians under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The letter implies the SEC will not pursue enforcement action if advisers follow the conditions outlined. To qualify as a custodian, state-chartered trusts must be governed by a US state banking authority like the Department of Financial Services in New York or the Division of Banking in South Dakota. The trusts must also provide independent control reports, audited financial statements that comply with GAAP, and custodial agreements forbidding the rehypothecation of client assets without their consent. It also outlines additional safeguards, including keeping client assets off the custodian’s balance sheet and periodic due diligence checks, including surprise audits. Trump Withdraws Brian Quintenz’s CFTC Nomination The Trump administration has withdrawn Brian Quintenz’s nomination as the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Quintenz confirmed the withdrawal, stating, “Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life. I am grateful to the president for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I look forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country.” The crypto industry vehemently backed Quintenz. However, his nomination was held up in Congress amid reported pushback from Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Quintenz had claimed the Winklevoss twins had interfered with his nomination and pressured President Donald Trump to drop his nomination. He also shared a series of texts between him and the Winklevoss twins on X, claiming Trump was being misled. Quintenz said at the time, “I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise. It’s my understanding that after this exchange, they contacted the president and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has bounced back to reclaim $115,000 after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $112,695. The flagship cryptocurrency rose by over 2% on Sunday to $112,000. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% and settled at $114,365. However, selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $112,695 before settling at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal drop. BTC is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,012. BTC’s start to October aligns with predictions that the bull market will resume in October. BTC and the broader cryptocurrency market suffered a substantial drop in September, with the flagship cryptocurrency falling to a low of $109,623 on September 25. Additionally, gold and traditional markets have posted record highs, and analysts expect BTC to catch up sooner rather than later. One analyst stated, “Bitcoin tends to follow gold, 3-4 months down the line. $BTC began to mimic gold’s ‘rise → pause → last minute spike’ pattern. If the correlation holds, $BTC is now ready for a last-minute spike through October/November, breaking out of its rising wedge.” According to 50TFunds CEO Dan Tapiero, Bitcoin’s October bull market is yet to begin. “Wake up. The bull market in Bitcoin has not started yet. Same price in gold terms as 5 years ago. Massive cup and handle leads to new upside price discovery. 4% short rates too high, Usd bear now, DC reg wind at back, Dats, Etfs, Stables, Defi, Rwas etc New world.” However, pro traders remain jittery about holding downside risks despite BTC’s recovery. This is because the derivatives markets show heightened fear. Investors are considering whether the metrics reflect market concerns or whether they are specific to the cryptocurrency market. BTC’s skew metric reached 5% on Tuesday before eventually returning to 8%, indicating a higher premium for put options. BTC’s skew metric generally ranges between -6% and 6% under normal conditions. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.41% to $115,282 on Sunday. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell by over 2% to $112,736. Sellers retained control on Tuesday with BTC falling 0.64% to a low of $111,502 before settling at $112,017.

Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has bounced back during the ongoing session after falling to a low of $4,094 on Tuesday. The altcoin faced substantial selling pressure last week, but has made an equally strong recovery to reclaim key levels. It started the week positively, rising over 3% on Sunday and 1.78% on Monday to settle at $4,218. The price fell almost 2% on Tuesday before recovering and crossing $4,300 during the ongoing session. ETH has held firm despite the US government shutdown. The political uncertainty could delay crucial US macroeconomic data, leaving markets pessimistic.

Massive cup and handle leads to new upside price discovery. 4% short rates too high, Usd bear now, DC reg wind at back, Dats, Etfs, Stables, Defi, Rwas etc New world.” However, pro traders remain jittery about holding downside risks despite BTC’s recovery. This is because the derivatives markets show heightened fear. Investors are considering whether the metrics reflect market concerns or whether they are specific to the cryptocurrency market. BTC’s skew metric reached 5% on Tuesday before eventually returning to 8%, indicating a higher premium for put options. BTC’s skew metric generally ranges between -6% and 6% under normal conditions.

Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has bounced back during the ongoing session after falling to a low of $4,094 on Tuesday. The altcoin faced substantial selling pressure last week, but has made an equally strong recovery to reclaim key levels. It started the week positively, rising over 3% on Sunday and 1.78% on Monday to settle at $4,218. The price fell almost 2% on Tuesday before recovering and crossing $4,300 during the ongoing session. ETH has held firm despite the US government shutdown. The political uncertainty could delay crucial US macroeconomic data, leaving markets pessimistic. The first government shutdown under President Trump lasted for three days, while the second stretched 35 days, becoming the longest government shutdown in US history. However, John Glover, chief investment officer at Ledn, is optimistic about how markets will fare, stating, “While this was previously used as a way to force the holdouts in Congress to be more flexible in negotiations, it was largely seen both times as a very temporary situation, and risk markets, which initially sold off, bounced back quickly. The market will consider any dip in digital asset prices due to a shutdown as a buying opportunity.” Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion announced that its ETH treasury has crossed 2.65 million ETH tokens, worth $10.8 billion, following a series of acquisitions. The company recently purchased 234,846 ETH valued at $961.5 million, significantly expanding its market dominance. The firm’s total cash holdings crossed $11.6 billion as of September 28. It also holds 192 BTC, worth $21 million, a $157 million stake in WLD treasury firm Eightco, and $436 million in unencumbered cash reserves.

The current session sees SOL at $216. Optimism around SOL has been rising after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted generic listing standards.

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes a Solana ETF approval is a certainty. Balchunas stated on X, “Honestly, the odds are really 100% now. Generic listing standards make the 19b-4s and their ‘clock’ meaningless.” Before the change, 19b-4 filings triggered a statutory review clock, giving the SEC a fixed timeline of 240 days to approve or deny an ETF. However, that timeline has become approval after the approval of the “generic listing standards.” “That just leaves the S-1s waiting for formal green light from Corp Finance. And they just submitted amendment #4 for Solana. The baby could come any day. Be ready.” Jeffrey Ding, chief analyst at HashKey Group, believes a Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying, followed by a “sell the news” correction. “A Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying ahead of approval, followed by a potential ‘sell the news’ correction once launched—similar to what we saw with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.” SOL traded in bearish territory on Sunday (September 21), dropping 1.36%.

        "url": "https://timestabloid.com/xrp-just-had-its-highest-quarterly-close-ever/",
        "body": "Some milestones in financial markets carry more weight than others, and for XRP , the close of the latest quarter marks one of those rare moments. Instead of fading into routine end-of-month trading, XRP ended September 2025 with a close that has set a new record in its history, sparking discussions across the crypto community about what comes next for the digital asset. Xoom, a respected commentator on X, drew attention to the event, emphasizing its importance. Verified market data supports the claim: XRP closed Q3 2025 at approximately $2.84, the highest quarterly close the asset has ever recorded. This figure surpasses notable past benchmarks, including the December 2017 quarter-end level of around $2.30, when XRP was riding the momentum of the last major bull cycle. XRP just had its highest quarterly close EVER. pic.twitter.com/c8udX6tsOx — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) October 1, 2025 The Significance of a Quarterly Close Quarterly closes are not just calendar markers. These levels hold significant technical importance, reflecting where the market has stabilized after prolonged trading pressure. Unlike daily or weekly closes, quarterly finishes reflect sustained conviction from both buyers and sellers, offering a more reliable signal of long-term strength. By closing above previous highs, XRP has effectively reset its technical foundation. Traders now see $2.84 as a key reference point — a price level that could act as strong support in future retracements or as the springboard for the next major breakout. Such levels are closely monitored by institutional players and retail investors alike, making this close particularly influential for upcoming market behavior. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Context Within the Crypto Market This milestone arrives at a time of renewed optimism across the digital asset sector. Institutional adoption continues to expand, supported by developments such as ETFs and the growing integration of blockchain into payment systems and financial services. XRP, long positioned as a solution for fast and efficient cross-border value transfer, appears well-placed to benefit from this momentum. Yet, the achievement should be viewed with a balanced perspective. A record quarterly close does not guarantee uninterrupted growth. Historically, markets often experience increased volatility following such milestones, as profit-taking and speculative positioning create short-term fluctuations. For XRP, traders will be watching closely to see if volume and liquidity can sustain momentum above this new level. Looking Ahead The highest quarterly close ever recorded for XRP is more than a number on a chart — it represents renewed strength, broader acceptance, and a shift in how the asset is perceived within the market. Investors now have a fresh benchmark to measure future moves, and analysts will be scrutinizing Q4 performance to see whether XRP can maintain and build upon this foundation. As Xoom highlighted, the close of September 2025 will be remembered as a turning point in XRP’s journey. With Q4 underway, the key question is no longer whether XRP can set records, but how high it can climb from here.

        "body": "The cryptocurrency market registered a marginal decline over the past 24 hours as prominent altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) , Ripple (XRP) , and Solana (SOL), fell into bearish territory. However, Bitcoin (BTC) defied bearish trends and is up nearly 1%, trading around $114,542. The flagship cryptocurrency traded around $112,874 on Tuesday but recovered from this level to start October in positive territory. BTC reached an intraday high of $114,744 before moving to its current level of $114,506. Meanwhile, ETH is struggling to regain momentum, with selling pressure pushing it back into the red. The altcoin briefly crossed $4,200 but lost momentum after reaching this level and moved to its current level of $4,142, down almost 1%. XRP is down over 1%, while SOL is marginally up, trading around $209. DOGE traded around $0.233, while Cardano (ADA) is up 1.35%, trading around $0.805. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. However, Toncoin (TON) and Litecoin (LTC) bucked the bearish trend to register marginal increases. CZ Warns BNB Chain’s Official Account May Be Compromised Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has warned that the official X account of BNB Chain could be compromised. The breach came to light after the official account posted a suspicious link promoting a fake BSC rewards program. Zhao stated on his official account, “The BNB Chain X account may have been compromised. Please do not click on any links recently posted from this account. The teams are investigating and will share updates as soon as possible.” The suspicious post on the BNB Chain account urged users to vote on an upcoming BSC rewards site and claimed early rewards would be given to participants within 24 hours. The message included a phishing link to steal unsuspecting users’ digital assets and private data. The warning comes after Zhao said earlier that the BNB Chain account may have been compromised. Binance is yet to issue an official statement. Ripple, Coinbase, And BitGo Could Qualify As Custodians The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cleared the path for Ripple, BitGo, and Coinbase to become custodians for crypto assets. The regulator’s Division of Investment Management issued a no-action letter on September 30 in response to a request from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. The SEC’s latest guidance allows investment advisers to use state-chartered trust companies as custodians under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The letter implies the SEC will not pursue enforcement action if advisers follow the conditions outlined. To qualify as a custodian, state-chartered trusts must be governed by a US state banking authority like the Department of Financial Services in New York or the Division of Banking in South Dakota. The trusts must also provide independent control reports, audited financial statements that comply with GAAP, and custodial agreements forbidding the rehypothecation of client assets without their consent. It also outlines additional safeguards, including keeping client assets off the custodian’s balance sheet and periodic due diligence checks, including surprise audits. Trump Withdraws Brian Quintenz’s CFTC Nomination The Trump administration has withdrawn Brian Quintenz’s nomination as the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Quintenz confirmed the withdrawal, stating, “Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life. I am grateful to the president for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I look forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country.” The crypto industry vehemently backed Quintenz. However, his nomination was held up in Congress amid reported pushback from Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Quintenz had claimed the Winklevoss twins had interfered with his nomination and pressured President Donald Trump to drop his nomination. He also shared a series of texts between him and the Winklevoss twins on X, claiming Trump was being misled. Quintenz said at the time, “I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise. It’s my understanding that after this exchange, they contacted the president and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has bounced back to reclaim $115,000 after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $112,695. The flagship cryptocurrency rose by over 2% on Sunday to $112,000. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% and settled at $114,365. However, selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $112,695 before settling at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal drop. BTC is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,012. BTC’s start to October aligns with predictions that the bull market will resume in October. BTC and the broader cryptocurrency market suffered a substantial drop in September, with the flagship cryptocurrency falling to a low of $109,623 on September 25. Additionally, gold and traditional markets have posted record highs, and analysts expect BTC to catch up sooner rather than later. One analyst stated, “Bitcoin tends to follow gold, 3-4 months down the line. $BTC began to mimic gold’s ‘rise → pause → last minute spike’ pattern. If the correlation holds, $BTC is now ready for a last-minute spike through October/November, breaking out of its rising wedge.” According to 50TFunds CEO Dan Tapiero, Bitcoin’s October bull market is yet to begin. “Wake up.

        "body": "The crypto market experienced a boost on Wednesday with majors bitcoin BTC and ether ETH rising 2.9% and 3.1% respectively. But the real story was in the altcoin market as several tokens rose by double-digits as investors speculate on another phase of \"atlcoin season.\" ZEC hit its highest point since May 2022 while a number of DeFi tokens also experienced moves to the upside. The market uptick comes alongside a backdrop of the U.S. government shutdown, which has spurred gold prices to record highs and caused a sell-off in the dollar. Derivatives Positioning by Jacob Joseph The BTC futures market continues to show a strengthening bullish bias. The overall futures open interest remains high at around $31.69 billion, reflecting sustained trader engagement, with Binance still leading the pack at $13.19 billion. Concurrently, the 3-month annualized basis is holding firm between 6% and 7%, indicating that the yield from the basis trade remains robust. This consistent metric across both open interest and basis suggests that traders are not only increasing their exposure but are doing so with conviction, reinforcing the positive sentiment observed in the market. The BTC options market continues to show a divergence between its key metrics, presenting a complex picture of market sentiment. While the 25 Delta Skew for short-term options remains low, suggesting that traders are still willing to pay a premium for puts to hedge against downside risk, the 24-hour Put/Call Volume points to a surge in bullish speculation. The latest data shows that calls now make up 63.54% of the total volume, a strong reversal from a put-dominated market. This conflicting data indicates a highly polarized environment where some traders are hedging against potential price drops, while a larger number are actively betting on a short-term rally. Funding rates have not only remained positive on major exchanges like Binance and OKX, but have picked up across the board, including on the historically volatile Hyperliquid. Deribit, in particular, is seeing a significant premium, with its annualized funding rate jumping to 17%. This indicates a strong and sustained demand for leveraged long positions, as traders are consistently willing to pay a high premium to hold their bullish bets. The widespread positive funding across all major platforms signals a collective market conviction in a continued upward trend for BTC. Coinglass data shows $644 million in 24 hour liquidations, with a 38-62 split between longs and shorts. BTC ($166 million), ETH ($164 million) and Others ($69 million) were the leaders in terms of notional liquidations. Binance liquidation heatmap indicates $116,650 as a core liquidation level to monitor, in case of a price rise. Token Talk By Oliver Knight Privacy token zcash (ZEC) is leading the pack on Wednesday, rising to its highest point since May 2022 following a break out against its bitcoin and dollar trading pairs. ZEC touched $97.25 before retreating back to around $92.00 - a 41% rise for the day on the back of a 36% rise in daily trading volume to $300 million. The surge comes alongside a boost across the wider altcoin market, with DeFi tokens ethena (ENA), curve (CRV) and raydium (RAY) all increasing by more than 8%. A number of catalysts triggered the crypto recovery; notably the U.S. government shutdown that brought the dollar lower and gold to fresh record highs at $3,887. Altcoins have outperformed bitcoin so far on Wednesday, although it's worth noting that the average crypto relative strength index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory, suggesting that a period of consolidation is on the cards as the market begins to cool. One market outlier was aster, the native token of its namesake's BNB Chain-based perpetual exchange. ASTER slumped by 6.8% on Wednesday to compound a 25% decline over the past week as hype in the HyperLiquid rival begins to fade.",

        "body": "By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin (BTC) moved higher amid the U.S. government shutdown and its up roughly 3% in the last 24 hours to $116,400. The broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 index ( CD20 ) rose 3.5%. Equities markets excluding the U.S. also moved higher, even as traders remain cautious over the shutdown. Europe’s STOXX 50 is up 0.3% in today’s session, while the FTSE 100 rose 0.7%. Futures on the S&P 500 are, however, down 0.55% while on the Nasdaq they’re down 0.64%. The U.S. government shutdown could lead to economic data delays, which are compounded by looming tariffs on various items. This has seemingly seen investors move away from the country and into alternative stores of value. That uncertainty has seen the price of gold rise 3.75% in the past week to now hover around $3,890 per ounce. Spot crypto ETFs drew in more than $550 million in net inflows on Sept. 30, with spot bitcoin ETFs representing the lion’s share of that figure. The flight to alternative assets is occurring against a favorable macroeconomic backdrop. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep cutting interest rates this month, with Polymarket traders weighing an 85% chance of a 25 bps cut. That figure is near 95% in the CME’s Fedwatch tool. Lower interest rates could make risk assets, which include cryptocurrencies, more appetizing for investors. Institutional involvement has also deepened amid the changing monetary policy. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) overtook Deribit to become the top venue for bitcoin options trading by open interest, now near $38 billion. “We have seen the convergence of both institutional backing and maturation across the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin is more embedded in the foundations of global finance, and institutional interest is at an all-time high,” Dom Harz, co-foudner of Bitcoin DeFi gateway BOB, told CoinDesk. “Unlike previous years, this Uptober will see more targeted inflows, which could be a breakout moment in accelerating Bitcoin DeFi, as investors will want to do more with their Bitcoin holdings; transforming it from a static store-of-value into a yield-bearing asset class,” he added. Indeed, bitcoin exposure coupled with yield appears to be becoming a new trend. Just this morning Swiss digital bank Sygnym launched a new BTC Alpha Fund , aiming to generate yield on bitcoin without reducing exposure to the cryptocurrency’s price movements. While traditional markets are likely to see lower volatility due the upcoming data vacuum from the government shutdown, crypto market see a wave of spot ETF decisions in the near future to look forward to. The SEC is scheduled to make decisions on a total of 16 spot crypto ETF applications this month. Stay alert!

        "body": "Changpeng Zhao (CZ), founder of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, issued a warning today and announced that BNB Chain's official X account was hacked. CZ said in his post that BNB Chain's official X account was hacked. Numerous posts regarding the mysterious Airdrop announcement from BNB Chain's X account have set off alarm bells. CZ took immediate action and warned of a possible risk. The hackers announced an airdrop and shared a link to an address in their posts. However, no such airdrop was mentioned on the project's official website. The links shared in the airdrop announcement were directed to a fake BNB Chain website with a different domain name, which was a “phishing attack” where hackers were able to obtain personal information and credentials from a user trying to log in. Warning about possible risks, CZ asked users to connect their wallets to the requested link. “BNBCHAIN X account has been compromised. The hacker posted links to a series of phishing websites asking for Wallet Connect. DO NOT tie your wallet…” In a subsequent statement, the team announced that they had regained full access to the BNB Chain account and stated that the estimated loss was only $8,000. Stating that all victims will be compensated for their losses, the BNB Chain team shared the information they obtained: The root cause of this breach is still under active investigation, and we will update you as soon as possible. The estimated damages are $8,000, and full compensation will be paid to the victims. Here's what we've gathered so far: – 10 phishing links were shared across all chains, resulting in the theft of $8,000. – The largest single victim was a single user who lost $6,500. – A phishing contract address was distributed. The attacker initially injected $17,800 and sold all of their meme tokens for $22,000. We are so grateful to our community and partners for their rapid spread of the word, vigilance, and support throughout this incident.” Despite the hack, the BNB price remained stable, falling only 1% in the last 24 hours. BNB continues to trade at $1,010. Update on Account Security Incident We’re back! The team has regained full access of the @BNBCHAIN account. The root cause of this breach is still under active investigation and we will share the updates as soon as we can.

The flagship cryptocurrency traded around $112,874 on Tuesday but recovered from this level to start October in positive territory. BTC reached an intraday high of $114,744 before moving to its current level of $114,506. Meanwhile, ETH is struggling to regain momentum, with selling pressure pushing it back into the red. The altcoin briefly crossed $4,200 but lost momentum after reaching this level and moved to its current level of $4,142, down almost 1%.

Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. However, Toncoin (TON) and Litecoin (LTC) bucked the bearish trend to register marginal increases. CZ Warns BNB Chain’s Official Account May Be Compromised Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has warned that the official X account of BNB Chain could be compromised. The breach came to light after the official account posted a suspicious link promoting a fake BSC rewards program. Zhao stated on his official account, “The BNB Chain X account may have been compromised. Please do not click on any links recently posted from this account. The teams are investigating and will share updates as soon as possible.” The suspicious post on the BNB Chain account urged users to vote on an upcoming BSC rewards site and claimed early rewards would be given to participants within 24 hours. The message included a phishing link to steal unsuspecting users’ digital assets and private data. The warning comes after Zhao said earlier that the BNB Chain account may have been compromised. Binance is yet to issue an official statement. Ripple, Coinbase, And BitGo Could Qualify As Custodians The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cleared the path for Ripple, BitGo, and Coinbase to become custodians for crypto assets. The regulator’s Division of Investment Management issued a no-action letter on September 30 in response to a request from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. The SEC’s latest guidance allows investment advisers to use state-chartered trust companies as custodians under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The letter implies the SEC will not pursue enforcement action if advisers follow the conditions outlined. To qualify as a custodian, state-chartered trusts must be governed by a US state banking authority like the Department of Financial Services in New York or the Division of Banking in South Dakota. The trusts must also provide independent control reports, audited financial statements that comply with GAAP, and custodial agreements forbidding the rehypothecation of client assets without their consent. It also outlines additional safeguards, including keeping client assets off the custodian’s balance sheet and periodic due diligence checks, including surprise audits. Trump Withdraws Brian Quintenz’s CFTC Nomination The Trump administration has withdrawn Brian Quintenz’s nomination as the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Quintenz confirmed the withdrawal, stating, “Being nominated to chair the CFTC and going through the confirmation process was the honor of my life. I am grateful to the president for that opportunity and to the Senate Agriculture Committee for its consideration. I look forward to returning to my private sector endeavors during this exciting time for innovation in our country.” The crypto industry vehemently backed Quintenz. However, his nomination was held up in Congress amid reported pushback from Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Quintenz had claimed the Winklevoss twins had interfered with his nomination and pressured President Donald Trump to drop his nomination. He also shared a series of texts between him and the Winklevoss twins on X, claiming Trump was being misled. Quintenz said at the time, “I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise. It’s my understanding that after this exchange, they contacted the president and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has bounced back to reclaim $115,000 after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $112,695. The flagship cryptocurrency rose by over 2% on Sunday to $112,000. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% and settled at $114,365. However, selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $112,695 before settling at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal drop. BTC is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,012. BTC’s start to October aligns with predictions that the bull market will resume in October. BTC and the broader cryptocurrency market suffered a substantial drop in September, with the flagship cryptocurrency falling to a low of $109,623 on September 25. Additionally, gold and traditional markets have posted record highs, and analysts expect BTC to catch up sooner rather than later. One analyst stated, “Bitcoin tends to follow gold, 3-4 months down the line. $BTC began to mimic gold’s ‘rise → pause → last minute spike’ pattern. If the correlation holds, $BTC is now ready for a last-minute spike through October/November, breaking out of its rising wedge.” According to 50TFunds CEO Dan Tapiero, Bitcoin’s October bull market is yet to begin. “Wake up. The bull market in Bitcoin has not started yet. Same price in gold terms as 5 years ago. Massive cup and handle leads to new upside price discovery. 4% short rates too high, Usd bear now, DC reg wind at back, Dats, Etfs, Stables, Defi, Rwas etc New world.” However, pro traders remain jittery about holding downside risks despite BTC’s recovery. This is because the derivatives markets show heightened fear. Investors are considering whether the metrics reflect market concerns or whether they are specific to the cryptocurrency market. BTC’s skew metric reached 5% on Tuesday before eventually returning to 8%, indicating a higher premium for put options. BTC’s skew metric generally ranges between -6% and 6% under normal conditions. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.41% to $115,282 on Sunday. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell by over 2% to $112,736. Sellers retained control on Tuesday with BTC falling 0.64% to a low of $111,502 before settling at $112,017. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 1% to reclaim $113,000 and settling at $113,348. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment returned on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, rising 0.61% but was back in the red on Saturday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $109,681. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $112,000 and settle at $112,197. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 2% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,365. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC fell to a low of $112,695 on Tuesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $114,067, ultimately registering a marginal decline. The price is up almost 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,209. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has bounced back during the ongoing session after falling to a low of $4,094 on Tuesday. The altcoin faced substantial selling pressure last week, but has made an equally strong recovery to reclaim key levels. It started the week positively, rising over 3% on Sunday and 1.78% on Monday to settle at $4,218. The price fell almost 2% on Tuesday before recovering and crossing $4,300 during the ongoing session. ETH has held firm despite the US government shutdown. The political uncertainty could delay crucial US macroeconomic data, leaving markets pessimistic. The first government shutdown under President Trump lasted for three days, while the second stretched 35 days, becoming the longest government shutdown in US history. However, John Glover, chief investment officer at Ledn, is optimistic about how markets will fare, stating, “While this was previously used as a way to force the holdouts in Congress to be more flexible in negotiations, it was largely seen both times as a very temporary situation, and risk markets, which initially sold off, bounced back quickly. The market will consider any dip in digital asset prices due to a shutdown as a buying opportunity.” Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion announced that its ETH treasury has crossed 2.65 million ETH tokens, worth $10.8 billion, following a series of acquisitions. The company recently purchased 234,846 ETH valued at $961.5 million, significantly expanding its market dominance. The firm’s total cash holdings crossed $11.6 billion as of September 28. It also holds 192 BTC, worth $21 million, a $157 million stake in WLD treasury firm Eightco, and $436 million in unencumbered cash reserves. BitMine aims to acquire 5% of ETH’s circulating supply, equalling 6.04 million tokens at current levels. ETH ended the previous weekend down almost 1% at $4,479. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 6% to $4,202, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $4,079. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH fell almost 1% to $4,166. The price registered a marginal drop on Wednesday before plunging nearly 7% on Thursday as bearish sentiment intensified. As a result, ETH fell below the crucial $4,000 mark and settled at $3,876. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH recovered on Friday, rising over 4% to reclaim $4,000 and settle at $4,014. The price registered a marginal drop on Saturday but regained momentum on Sunday, rising over 3% to settle at $4,144. Buyers retained control on Monday despite selling pressure as ETH rose almost 2% to cross $4,200 and settle at $4,218. Despite the positive sentiment, the price fell nearly 2% on Tuesday and settled at $4,145. ETH has recovered during the ongoing session, up over 4% and trading around $4,317. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is up almost 4% as bullish sentiment returned after Tuesday’s drop to a low of $204. The altcoin has been on an upward trajectory since Friday, reaching $210 on Sunday. The price continued pushing higher on Saturday, reaching $212 before dropping over 2% to $208. The current session sees SOL at $216. Optimism around SOL has been rising after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted generic listing standards. The new listing standards have made the 19b-4 review clock irrelevant and shifted the approval process to S-1 registrations. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes a Solana ETF approval is a certainty. Balchunas stated on X, “Honestly, the odds are really 100% now. Generic listing standards make the 19b-4s and their ‘clock’ meaningless.” Before the change, 19b-4 filings triggered a statutory review clock, giving the SEC a fixed timeline of 240 days to approve or deny an ETF. However, that timeline has become approval after the approval of the “generic listing standards.” “That just leaves the S-1s waiting for formal green light from Corp Finance. And they just submitted amendment #4 for Solana. The baby could come any day. Be ready.” Jeffrey Ding, chief analyst at HashKey Group, believes a Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying, followed by a “sell the news” correction. “A Solana ETF could trigger speculative buying ahead of approval, followed by a potential ‘sell the news’ correction once launched—similar to what we saw with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.” SOL traded in bearish territory on Sunday (September 21), dropping 1.36%. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell nearly 7% to $220, but not before dropping to a low of $213. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as SOL fell over 3% and settled at $213. The price fell to an intraday low of $204 on Wednesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $211, ultimately falling 0.77%. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as SOL fell almost 9%, slipping below $200 and settling at $192. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, the price recovered on Friday, rising over 6% to reclaim $200 and settle at $205. Price action was mixed over the weekend, with SOL falling 0.83% on Saturday to $203. However, it was back in positive territory on Sunday, rising nearly 4% and settling at $210. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose almost 1% to $212. Despite the positive sentiment, SOL was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping over 2% to $208. The price has increased by almost 4% during the current session, trading around $216. Celestia (TIA) Price Analysis Celestia (TIA) ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping over 2% to $1.683. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell almost 11% to a low of $1.413 before settling at $1.499. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell over 2% to $1.468. TIA fell 1.20% on Wednesday and over 6% on Thursday as bearish sentiment intensified. As a result, the price fell to a low of $1.337 before settling at $1.362. Source: TradingView Despite the selling pressure, TIA rebounded on Friday, rising nearly 5% and settling at $1.425. Price action was mixed over the weekend as TIA registered a marginal drop on Saturday before rising 0.32% on Sunday to settle at $1.419. Selling pressure returned on Monday as the price fell almost 1% to $1.406. TIA fell to an intraday low of $1.343 before settling at $1.379, ultimately dropping 1.96%. TIA is up almost 4% during the ongoing session, trading around $1.430. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis Cardano (ADA) dropped over 1% on Sunday (September 21), falling to $0.885. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell almost 7% to a low of $0.790 before settling at $0.825. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ADA fell over 2% to $0.807. Despite the selling pressure, the price recovered on Wednesday, rising 1% to $0.813. Bearish sentiment returned on Thursday as ADA fell 6.03% to $0.764. Source: TradingView ADA recovered on Friday, rising almost 4% to $0.793. Price action was mixed over the weekend as the altcoin fell 1.26% on Saturday before rising 3% on Sunday and settling at $0.809.

        "url": "https://finbold.com/privacy-coin-zcash-up-40-in-a-day-is-100-next/",
        "body": "The privacy-focused cryptocurrency, Zcash ( ZEC ), has climbed as much as 40% in a day and soared more than 70% over the past seven days. A major catalyst for the rally came from decentralized exchange ( DEX ) THORSwap, which announced full support for Zcash swaps, allowing users to trade the asset against top performers like Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Solana ( SOL ). Meanwhile, network activity also picked up, as Zcash Community Grants recently launched a Rust repo for Multi-Factor Key Derivation Function (MFKDF), giving developers new tools to experiment with. At the time of writing, ZEC is trading at $92.62, up 42.18% on the 24-hour chart and posting the best daily performance in percentage terms among all crypotcurrencies in the top 100 by market cap, as per CoinMarketCap data retrieved by Finbold. With a market cap of over $1.5 billion, it is currently the 65th largest crypto. Top-performing cryptocurrencies. Source: CoinMarketCap Will Zcash hit $100? It is possible the sudden surge in ZEC activity isn’t mere short-term speculation, as the timing coincides with the ongoing debates around financial and digital ID surveillance. This is evident from the impact of the Zashi cross-chain swap update on September 16, which led to shielded transactions surging to 3.06 million ZEC and Google searches for “privacy coins” hitting record highs . However, the asset is not propped by mere panic alone, as technical indicators likewise suggest strong upward momentum. Namely, ZEC has skyrocketed way past the $56 resistance level dating back to June 2022. At the same time, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) of 83.69 and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) level of 7.95 reinforce the bullish picture. Crypto analyst and commentator Vini Barbosa discussed the climb in market cap, noting that ZEC had climbed past the likes of TRUMP ( TRUMP ) and Immutable ( IMX ), going from the 92nd to the 65th largest crypto in only nine days. JUST IN: $ZEC is ranked #65 @ $1.52B market cap 1 ZEC = $93.70 (+230% YoY, +130% MoM) > 18 hours ago, ZEC was #72 @ $1.19B, > only seven days ago it was #87 @ $880M, > nine days ago, Zcash was a #92 coin @ $775M Still below BONK, SKY, and Filecoin, passing TRUMP, JUMP, and IMX https://t.co/18lfWwIfhw pic.twitter.com/pIXp3L1DaC — Vini Barbosa (@vinibarbosabr) October 1, 2025 Accordingly, if the trend continues in the following days, a $100 price target appears more than likely, although any long-term strength will hinge on the positive reception of the new integrations and network upgrades.

        "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/saylor-trillion-dollar-bitcoin-empire-pumps-hyper/",
        "body": "Michael Saylor’s $BTC ambitions know no bounds. Now, he plans for his company – Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) – to stack up $1T of the world’s largest crypto asset. Even as critics get louder about the company’s $BTC buying strategy, Saylor remains unfazed. As more $BTC is scooped up, projects building on Bitcoin, such as Bitcoin Hyper, are likely to see their utility and demand accelerate. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , now in presale, is a Layer-2 (L2) scaling solution being developed to address the Bitcoin network’s pain points. And it’ll only help as demand peaks. Strategy’s $47.35B $BTC Stash Generates $27B in Returns In 2020, Strategy boldly pivoted from business software to a digital asset-focused balance sheet. And boy, has it paid off. The company is now the largest corporate holder of $BTC worldwide. Currently, Strategy holds a total of 640,031 $BTC, following a recent purchase of 196 $BTC worth approximately $22.1M. The total stash was accumulated for roughly $47.35B at an average price of about $73,983. However, with $BTC now trading at $116,5K , Strategy is sitting on over $27B in unrealized gains. Despite the humongous profit, Strategy’s large $BTC buys have received some backlash. Take short-seller Jim Chano, for instance. He slammed the company’s valuation by calling it ‘financial gibberish.’ Not helping matters, Chanos argues that Strategy’s market cap shouldn’t exceed the value of its $BTC holdings. Yet, in June, the company’s $108B valuation was around 1.74x its $62.27B worth of $BTC – a cap critics say creates an arbitrage opportunity. Peter Schiff, chief economist at Euro Pacific Capital, also criticizes Strategy. In an X post last week, he called the firm’s approach ‘harebrained’ and noted that Strategy ($MSTR) is down 45% from its November 2024 peak. Still, ongoing criticism hasn’t deterred other firms from betting big on the crypto king. 108 Public Companies Now Hold $119.5B Worth of $BTC CoinMarketCap data shows that 108 public companies now hold 1,029,413 $BTC worth over $119.5B – 4.90% of the asset’s total supply. Behind Strategy, MARA Holdings is the second-largest $BTC treasury, holding 52,477 $BTC, valued at over $6B. Meanwhile, XXI is firmly in third place, holding 43,514 $BTC worth roughly $5.05B. These companies, including the likes of Metaplanet (which recently established a US subsidiary to expand its $BTC income business ), view the crypto leader as a long-term investment with high profit potential. But as more capital flows into the Bitcoin ecosystem, the network often becomes congested. In turn, this results in slow transaction speeds and high fees — a less-than-ideal setup for users. This is where Bitcoin Hyper steps in. Bitcoin Hyper to Make Bitcoin as Efficient as Solana Bitcoin Hyper is on a mission to address the Bitcoin network’s biggest limitations. Once launched this quarter, its L2 chain will leverage the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to make the Bitcoin network faster, cheaper, and more scalable. Right now, Bitcoin can only process 4.2 transactions per second (TPS) , ~18,521% less than Solana’s 782.1 TPS . In fact, Solana far outpaces Bitcoin in many key performance areas. The network’s maximum throughput reaches 4,709 tps, roughly 357x higher than Bitcoin’s 13.2 tps peak. And that’s not all. Solana’s block time average is much higher at 0.39 seconds compared to Bitcoin’s 9 minutes and 35 seconds. But it’s not just the utilization of the SVM that’ll make the L2 more scalable – the addition of a Canonical Bridge will help, too. The bridge will enable the movement of wrapped versions of $BTC across the Bitcoin mainnet and the L2 network. In doing so, $BTC can be used across DeFi, dApps, NFTs, and other Web3 ecosystems. This unlocks new use cases previously unseen on Bitcoin, which will also boost liquidity. All while preserving the inherent security of Bitcoin’s base layer. Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, global mining network, and decentralized validator base make it highly resistant to attacks and manipulation. $HYPER Powers the Bitcoin L2’s Utility, Scalability & Growth At the core of the entire ecosystem is $HYPER , the project’s native token that drives utility, sustainability, and scalability. The presale tokenomics show that a hefty 30% of its total token supply is earmarked to fund ongoing development, while an extra 25% is reserved for the ecosystem treasury. Supporting the project and buying $HYPER on presale – currently available for just $0.013005 – comes with several additional perks. From lower gas fees to governance rights and passive income at a 60% APY through staking (or all three!), holding $HYPER unlocks attractive, exclusive benefits to holders. If you’re interested in staking for gains, there’s no better time to do precisely that; the APY will drop as more investors catch on. Experts predict $HYPER could reach $0.32 after it’s listed on some of the best crypto exchanges . This alone could generate over 24x returns, and that’s without factoring in any staking income. Weighing all these points together, it’s no surprise $HYPER has raised over $19.5M already, with recent whale buys as big as $113.8K , $109.9K , and $105.4K . Start stacking like Strategy — Join Bitcoin Hyper today. Disclaimer: The information provided is solely for educational and informational purposes.
