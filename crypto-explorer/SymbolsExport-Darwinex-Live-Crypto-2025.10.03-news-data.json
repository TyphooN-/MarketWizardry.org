        "body": "tariff distribution Bitcoin: Redirecting a $1,000–$2,000 tariff distribution into Bitcoin can act as a concise, inflation-resistant savings strategy. Bitcoin offers fractional ownership, wide liquidity, and a proven long-term return profile that has turned small stimulus allocations into substantial gains over multi‑year windows. Immediate hedge against inflation: Bitcoin is often used as a store-of-value alternative to cash. Small allocations (e.g., $1,000–$2,000) buy fractional BTC and fit dollar-cost averaging strategies. Historical data: past U.S. stimulus rounds invested in crypto produced multi-hundred-percent gains for some investors. tariff distribution Bitcoin — Learn why investing a tariff check in Bitcoin can hedge inflation and capture growth. Read step-by-step guidance and key takeaways. What is a tariff distribution and how could Bitcoin benefit? tariff distribution Bitcoin refers to using tariff revenue to distribute cash payments to citizens. Investing that cash in Bitcoin can offer inflation protection, fractional exposure to a liquid global asset, and potential long-term capital appreciation compared with holding fiat. How would a $2,000 tariff distribution affect Bitcoin demand? A $2,000 distribution increases retail liquidity available for markets. Historical parallels: U.S. stimulus rounds in 2020–2021 saw an estimated portion of checks flow into stocks and crypto. A $1,200 stimulus invested in Bitcoin on April 11, 2020 (~$6,878 per BTC) would have harvested roughly 0.1744 BTC, worth about $21,270 at a later valuation—illustrating how modest amounts can compound. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Why investing a tariff distribution in Bitcoin could make sense\", \"alternativeHeadline\": \"How a Trump-era tariff distribution might be invested into Bitcoin\", \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-04T09:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-04T09:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/images/coinotag-logo.png\" } }, \"description\": \"An analysis of why directing tariff distribution payments into Bitcoin could be a practical hedge and investment strategy for Americans receiving $1,000–$2,000 payments.\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/article/tariff-distribution-bitcoin\" }} Why consider Bitcoin for a tariff-inspired payout? Bitcoin offers scarcity (21 million supply cap), global liquidity, and fractional ownership, enabling even $1,000 purchases to meaningfully participate in long-term market moves. For many investors, those attributes make Bitcoin a practical option for preserving purchasing power and pursuing growth. How did past stimulus payments impact crypto markets? Past U.S. stimulus checks coincided with crypto rallies. According to reports at the time, up to an estimated $40 billion of stimulus funds flowed into stocks and crypto. Example: investing the initial $1,200 stimulus in April 2020 into Bitcoin (~$6,878) would have resulted in significant percentage gains over subsequent years. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to invest a tariff distribution into Bitcoin\", \"description\": \"Step-by-step guidance for allocating a $1,000–$2,000 tariff distribution into Bitcoin safely and strategically.\", \"totalTime\": \"PT30M\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Decide allocation\", \"text\": \"Choose a conservative percentage of the distribution to allocate to Bitcoin (for example 25%–50%).\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Select a wallet or exchange\", \"text\": \"Use a reputable custodial platform or a self-custody wallet to hold Bitcoin securely.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Purchase Bitcoin\", \"text\": \"Buy fractional Bitcoin using dollar-cost averaging or a lump-sum, depending on your risk profile.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Review and secure\", \"text\": \"Transfer to cold storage if long-term holding; enable strong security measures such as two-factor authentication.\" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Should I put my tariff distribution into Bitcoin?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Putting all or part of a tariff distribution into Bitcoin can provide inflation resistance and growth potential, but it should match your risk tolerance and financial goals.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How much BTC could a $2,000 payout buy?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"At current prices a $2,000 payout buys fractional Bitcoin (for example roughly 0.0165 BTC at a hypothetical price), enabling exposure without needing a full coin.\" } } ]} Should retirees or conservative savers use a tariff distribution to buy Bitcoin? Conservative savers should consider allocating a small portion of the distribution to Bitcoin while keeping emergency funds in cash and bonds. A modest allocation provides inflation exposure without overconcentration. Key Takeaways Small allocations can matter : Even $1,000–$2,000 buys fractional BTC with long-term upside potential. Historical precedent : Prior stimulus rounds saw material flows into crypto and stocks, producing significant gains for some holders. Security first : Use trusted custody solutions and best practices to protect holdings. Conclusion Redirecting a tariff distribution into Bitcoin can serve as a pragmatic hedge and growth tactic for Americans receiving $1,000–$2,000 checks. COINOTAG recommends weighing personal risk tolerance, using secure custody, and considering dollar-cost averaging to integrate cryptocurrency exposure responsibly. Published: 2025-10-04 — COINOTAG",

A single technical signal—especially on a higher-timeframe chart—can mark the difference between quiet consolidation and explosive upside. For XRP, that moment may be near. Analysts are closely monitoring the charts, where a rare combination of bullish signals is emerging, suggesting a potential price breakout could be imminent. Cryptoinsightuk Flags Bullish RSI Signal Market analyst Cryptoinsightuk has sounded the alarm for XRP holders, noting that the asset’s three-day chart is now showing a bullish Relative Strength Index (RSI) crossover alongside a strong three-day candle close. The analyst emphasized that this particular alignment has preceded major upward moves for XRP in the past—pointing to the last three instances on November 5, 2024, April 19, 2025, and June 27, 2025. We are in the territory where we could see a pop to the upside for $XRP at any point imo. We got a great 3 Day candle close yesterday and bullish cross on the 3 day RSI.

Understanding the Technical Setup A bullish RSI crossover occurs when short-term momentum breaks above its longer-term trend line—an early indication that buying pressure is starting to dominate. When this signal appears on the three-day timeframe, it’s more significant than similar signals on shorter intervals because it indicates sustained market strength rather than short-term volatility. Coupled with the recent strong candle close, this crossover suggests that bulls are regaining control after a period of consolidation. Historically, such alignments on XRP’s chart have led to strong continuation rallies, provided they are confirmed by volume and price action in subsequent sessions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Resistance Levels and Market Context From a technical perspective, XRP faces its next resistance band between $3.20 and $3.65, a region that has repeatedly capped price advances in 2025. A decisive breakout and sustained close above that zone could unlock further upside momentum , potentially validating the “pop” scenario that traders like Cryptoinsightuk anticipate. Broader market conditions also favor bullish sentiment. Bitcoin remains strong above six-figure levels, overall liquidity has improved across digital assets, and institutional participation in on-chain settlement projects continues to grow. These factors collectively create an environment in which XRP could benefit from renewed investor confidence. Risk and Confirmation While optimism is building, analysts caution that no technical indicator guarantees results. RSI crossovers can produce false signals if volume fails to confirm or if sudden macro news shifts sentiment. Traders are advised to manage risk carefully, watch for volume-supported breakouts, and avoid over-leveraging positions during volatility spikes. The Bottom Line With momentum indicators in sync and historical patterns resurfacing, XRP seems poised for a potential breakout. As Cryptoinsightuk highlights, the market is once again positioned where a strong upward move could emerge at any time. Whether that surge materializes will depend on confirmation in the coming days—but for now, XRP sits squarely in what analysts call breakout territory .

        "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp/",
        "body": "An alarming pattern of XRP whale activity has been noted, posing several questions about the sustainability of the cryptocurrency’s growth. Among the multiple questions currently being asked, one is more demanding of an immediate response: Is an XRP whale sell-off on its way? XRP Supply Surges Across Major Exchanges In an October 3rd post on the social media platform X, market analyst CryptoOnchain highlighted a recent shift in the behavior of XRP’s largest holders, the whales. The online pundit’s report was based on the Exchange Supply Ratio indicator, which tracks the proportion of XRP tokens on exchanges relative to its total circulating supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Exchange Inflows Hit $5.7B: Profit-Taking Already Underway? This metric can be used to derive insights on potential selling pressure for a crypto asset (XRP, in this case), seeing as higher values would suggest increased availability of tokens on the exchange for sale. According to CryptoOnchain, there has been a spike in XRP supply across major exchanges, suggesting that whales might be positioning for a significant sell-off. The data shared reflects the increase in selling pressure across these exchanges, including Bithumb, Bitget, Bitfinex, and Binance, putting the XRP price at an increased risk of a sharp correction. XRP Displays Bearish Divergence As Sellers Dominate Futures Market In a separate post made on the CryptoQuant platform, CryptoOnchain also revealed a budding negative divergence across the XRP futures market. The relevant indicator here is the Taker Buy Sell Ratio metric, which monitors the balance between aggressive buy and sell orders in the futures market. This metric is typically used to assess whether buyers or sellers are dominating the market in the short term. The analyst noted that while the price of XRP has been mostly around $3 after its recent rise, the ‘Taker Ratio’ across exchanges has fallen to its lowest level since November 2024. Interestingly, data from Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, further supports this bearish signal, as patterns similar to those seen on other exchanges have also been surfacing. Related Reading: Ethereum Matches Bitcoin In Annual Gains: What This Means For The Market CryptoOnchain explained that this situation could either mean that the market participants are booking profits or anticipating a price decline in the near future. However, the spike in XRP supply across major crypto exchanges, alongside the clear dominance of sellers in the perpetual futures market, strongly suggests the imminence of a price correction. It is therefore advisable to watch the psychological $3 level closely before market decisions are made. As of this writing, XRP is hovering around the $3 mark, reflecting a nearly 2% decline in the past 24 hours. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView",

        "body": "SOL is holding firm at $200 as it battles to stay afloat. Several factors suggest it could rebound soon. Besides Solana, two other projects are contending for dominance: Ripple (XRP) and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Each one of them is gaining significant attention in the crypto space. Their setup suggests that they could dominate in 2025. In this article, we will discuss each and find out which one will win in 2025. Solana (SOL): Institutional Magnet With Expanding On-Chain Utility Solana (SOL) trades near $203, after a pullback from earlier-month highs. However, on-chain activity remains robust. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) stands at around $13–14 billion, with healthy DEX and perpetual (perp) volumes supporting the network’s utility. Institutional flows have continued through the correction. The REX-Osprey Solana ETF experienced notable inflows of $65 million in mid-September, despite prices softening. Also, staking-oriented ETF products are expanding institutional access. Recent SEC rule changes have also lowered the bar for spot crypto ETFs, potentially accelerating product launches tied to SOL. Together, these factors suggest SOL could benefit if institutional allocation and on-chain demand persist. Ripple (XRP): Regulatory Clarity Meets Amidst Institutional Demand XRP trades near $2.80 as ETF optimism rises. It has recently partnered with DBS and Franklin Templeton to enable tokenized money-market fund trading on the XRP Ledger. This highlights institutional use cases beyond pure payments. The SEC’s September rule updates have also made multiple spot-ETF filings more feasible. This increases the odds of XRP-linked products and potential large inflows. Still, analysts caution that ETF approvals alone may not translate into sustained retail rallies unless institutional adoption leads to on-ledger volume and real-world flows. For instance, despite strong volume from the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF, XRP’s price has only fallen further below. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Culture Reinvented With Real Utility Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has positioned itself as a new frontier in meme tokens. It combines community-driven appeal with a solid technical foundation. Its presale, now in Stage 13, has already raised over $26.3 million and sold more than 16 billion tokens at $0.0022. This signals a strong early conviction among investors. Little Pepe is powered by Pepe Chain, an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 built for memes. The chain delivers low gas fees and fast finality. It also offers built-in protections against sniper bots. Its tokenomics are designed to reward sustainability. It includes zero buy/sell tax, staking mechanisms, and a share allocated for ecosystem growth. A key pillar is Pepe’s Pump Pad, the native launchpad that allows meme projects to deploy directly on the chain. Tokens launched via the pump pad help drive transaction volume, feeding demand back into LILPEPE itself. This creates a looping effect of utility and engagement. Credibility has been bolstered through a successful CertiK audit and listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. On the team side, Little Pepe is backed by anonymous experts with experience in meme project growth. This gives it a level of credibility that’s easily backed by its roadmap. Planned listings on two Tier-1 centralized exchanges at launch, along with future plans for the world’s largest exchange, could put LILPEPE in the spotlight as trading begins. Given its lower valuation, strong ecosystem design, and viral potential, Little Pepe may offer higher upside growth curves. SOL vs. XRP vs. LILPEPE: Which One Will Dominate in 2025? Solana offers institutional-grade security and broad infrastructure utilization. This makes it a reliable foundation for numerous blockchain applications. If demand for scalable smart contract platforms continues under regulatory clarity, SOL may capture substantial adoption. XRP’s strength lies in serving as a regulatory and institutional bridge—if legal frameworks favor financial token use cases, XRP could benefit strongly. Yet, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the wildcard. While SOL and XRP dominate with utility and legitimacy, LILPEPE blends memetic culture and core infrastructure, targeting the meme sector itself. In a cycle that may lean heavily on viral growth and novelty, LILPEPE could outperform in percentage gains. Analysts may see SOL capturing market share and XRP anchoring institutional flows. However, for raw upside, Little Pepe stands as the candidate with the most room to scale. Dominance depends on whether 2025 rewards infrastructure, regulation, or memetic innovation. And LILPEPE is best positioned if meme-utility fusion becomes the narrative. Conclusion Solana, Ripple, and Little Pepe each present a distinct path toward dominance in 2025. SOL combines infrastructure strength and adoption. On the other hand, XRP bridges financial legitimacy with crypto access. But it is Little Pepe that merges meme culture with technical depth, offering potentially explosive growth. Though it carries a higher risk, its robust presale performance, ecosystem development, and launchpad mechanics provide it with the framework to compete meaningfully. For investors seeking asymmetric upside in the meme sector, Little Pepe deserves serious consideration. Visit the Little Pepe website or join its Telegram to stay ahead of listings and developments.

        "body": "Solana resistance around $230 is weakening because heavy profit-taking and clustered long liquidity between $200–$220 have absorbed buys; SOL’s short-term bid is fragile, with on-chain metrics (NRPL, realized losses) showing capitulation risk while $200 remains the critical support. Solana faces a weakening $230 resistance due to realized profits and low rotational flow. Key risk: $200–$220 long clusters could trigger a retest of $200 if bids fail to hold.

What is causing Solana’s $230 resistance to weaken? Solana resistance around $230 is weakening because large profit realization and a lack of rotational buying reduced bid support. On-chain indicators show concentrated long liquidity and realized losses that increase downside vulnerability while buyers reassess risk around the $200–$230 band. How could SOL move before the next leg up? SOL could retest $200 if the $200–$220 long cluster is flushed. Short-term dynamics: a sell-off clears weak hands, potentially enabling a later push toward $250–$300, but only if bulls re-establish $200 as firm support and rotational flow returns. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Solana resistance at $230 weakens as heavy profit-taking and long clusters accumulate\", \"description\": \"Solana resistance at $230 is weakening; on-chain data shows large realized profits and long liquidity clustered in $200–$220, raising retest risk to $200.\", \"image\": [ \"https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SOLUSDT_2025-10-04_13-14-25.png\" ], \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-04T13:14:25Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-04T13:14:25Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png\" } }, \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/solana-resistance-230-analysis\" }} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to assess Solana $230 resistance and $200 support\", \"description\": \"Step-by-step checks analysts use to evaluate Solana resistance at $230 and downside risk to $200.\", \"image\": \"https://COINOTAG.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SOLUSDT_2025-10-04_13-14-25.png\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Check realized profit/loss metrics\", \"text\": \"Review realized profit data to see where large profits were taken; recent moves show ~ $1.03 billion realized near $234.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Locate long liquidity clusters\", \"text\": \"Identify long clusters between $200–$220; $200 million in overexposed longs increases retest risk.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Monitor NRPL and supply distribution\", \"text\": \"Watch NRPL flips and supply concentration at key price levels (5% supply at $224 noted) to gauge capitulation potential.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Confirm support with on-chain bids\", \"text\": \"Validate whether $200 holds with order-book bids and renewed rotational flow before positioning for a higher target.\" } ]} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Is Solana resistance at $230 breaking?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Solana resistance near $230 is weakening due to profit-taking and absent rotational bids; a retest of $200 is possible if $200–$220 long clusters are flushed.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How much SOL was realized around the recent top?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Approximately $1.03 billion worth of SOL was taken off the table around $234, equating to roughly 4.4 million SOL changing hands.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"What on-chain signals should traders monitor?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Traders should monitor NRPL, realized loss metrics, long liquidity clusters in the $200–$220 band, and supply concentration at $224 to assess risk.\" } } ]} Solana’s $200 support tested by heavy long positioning So far, Solana has been the most exposed to capitulation risk. NRPL flipped red at the back end of September as price broke below $224, triggering roughly $1.7 billion in realized losses and accelerating sell-side pressure. Massive profit-taking followed the run-up: on 2 October, nearly $1.03 billion in SOL were realized around $234, meaning approximately 4.4 million SOL changed hands. The immediate reaction pushed SOL down to $228 (about -2.5%), showing the resistance wall at $230 struggled to absorb selling. On-chain distribution matters: around 5% of supply remains clustered at $224. With $200 million in overexposed longs concentrated in the $200–$220 range, the risk of a move toward $200 remains material if bids fail. Source: TradingView (SOL/USDT) The market is shrugging off rotational bids, and on-chain data shows investors avoiding altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index fell four points to 67 at press time, highlighting muted risk appetite and constrained alt flows. After capitulation, SOL bounced ~18.5% off $200, with bulls briefly turning $200 into support and testing $230. But resistance around $230 remains a near-term ceiling unless rotational buying and fresh bids return. Source: Glassnode Frequently Asked Questions Could SOL test $200 again this quarter? Yes. If $230 resistance holds and the $200–$220 long cluster is flushed, SOL could retest $200. A sustained reclaim of $200 by bulls is needed to resume a bullish trajectory toward $250–$300. What on-chain metrics signal capitulation? Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) flips, large realized-loss events (~$1.7 billion in this episode) and concentrated supply at specific price points (e.g., 5% at $224) are classic capitulation signals. Key Takeaways Resistance weakness : Heavy profit-taking near $234 weakened the $230 resistance and removed buying momentum. Support vulnerability : $200 is critical; $200–$220 long clusters ($200M) raise retest risk. Actionable insight : Traders should monitor NRPL, realized volumes, and order-book bids around $200 before adding exposure. Conclusion Solana resistance at $230 is under pressure as realized profits and concentrated long liquidity increase downside risk. Watch on-chain NRPL, realized-loss events and the $200–$220 long cluster for clues; if $200 holds, SOL could clear weak hands and target higher levels in Q4. COINOTAG will monitor updates and on-chain flows. Published: 2025-10-04 | Updated: 2025-10-04 | Author: COINOTAG",

We expect POL to record a minimum price of $0.22 and a maximum price of $0.35, with an average of $0.27 in October. POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction October 2025 $0.22 $0.27 $0.35 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $0.15. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

        "body": "Investors are increasingly positive about Dogecoin (DOGE) as fresh retail interest and rising adoption drive hopes for the meme coin past $1.20 by December 2025. While that forecast is typical of the mania for DOGE’s loyal following and previous price spikes, enthusiasm in the crypto community is already shifting quickly towards a project with much greater potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . As much as DOGE remains social momentum and sentiment-dependent, MUTM is building actual, utility-based value through its two-pronged lending mechanism. Its presale has already raised over $16.8 million, attracted over 16,750 buyers, and is already over 55% sold out in Stage 6, a testimony to high retail and institutional confidence. Mutuum Finance can take flight from its current price of $0.035 to $3.50 in 2026 and possibly yield 100x returns, making it an even more revolutionary investment than DOGE for the next bull cycle. Dogecoin Bulls Steer as Momentum Builds Towards Key Resistance Levels Dogecoin (DOGE) is recovering its strength after bouncing from the $0.221 support level, with the price now trading at around $0.245 following a bullish intraday run that briefly hit $0.246. Analysts anticipate that maintaining support above $0.240 is the parameter to sustaining this trend, which can see DOGE hit $0.255 and $0.270 in the short term. A firm breakout can even lay the foundation for a charge to the psychologically significant $0.30 level, with buyers continuing to pile in and pace picking up. Heartening as this rebound is for DOGE holders, though, those in search of larger, utility-driven growth potential are increasingly focused on breakout DeFi player Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a trend that reflects changing market appetites away from meme-based gains. Mutuum Finance Presale Reaches New Heights Mutuum Finance is causing a splash in DeFi with its presale, having gained over 16,750 investors and raised over $16.8 million so far. Phase 6 of the presale is on course at 55% completion and selling MUTM tokens at $0.035 per token. In appreciation of its early investors, the team has also launched a $100,000 giveaway , to give 10 lucky winners 10,000 MUTM tokens each. Mutuum Finance is set to issue a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to bear markets-stopping algorithmic stablecoins, the token is non-algorithmic and overcollateralized and designed to become price-stable even in bear markets. The protocol also has a risk-adjusted Loan-to-Value (LTV) mechanism where each asset has an associated collateral cap depending on its risk factor. That is to facilitate proportionate and arm’s length lending. Besides covering users in bad times, the protocol also has a buffer reserve mechanism where riskier assets have higher reserves assigned as additional collateral and to subsidize the ecosystem. With its presale growth, risk management innovations, and transparency, Mutuum Finance is solidifying its position as a safe, stable, and innovative DeFi platform. Mutuum Finance Announces Development of Its Lending & Borrowing Solution Mutuum Finance has announced the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , a milestone in its DeFi strategy. The initial release (V1) of the protocol will be released on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with key features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and so on. Lending, borrowing, and the functionality of ETH and USDT as collateral will also be available at the initial release for users to make their first interactions with a robust open-and-shut matter for a rapid and secure decentralized finance platform. Dogecoin’s rise to $1.20 is a product of community-driven strength, but for those who crave true exponential growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has much greater potential. With tokens still only at $0.035 in phase 6 and well over 55% sold out already, MUTM’s two-sided lending system, overcollateralized stablecoin, and risk-adjusted architecture make it in a league of its own. Backed by $16.8 million in funds raised and 16,750+ investors, analysts believe MUTM has a chance to hit $3.50 in 2026, a potential 100× return that makes it a much more groundbreaking potential than DOGE in the next bull cycle.

Bitcoin offers fractional ownership, wide liquidity, and a proven long-term return profile that has turned small stimulus allocations into substantial gains over multi‑year windows. Immediate hedge against inflation: Bitcoin is often used as a store-of-value alternative to cash. Small allocations (e.g., $1,000–$2,000) buy fractional BTC and fit dollar-cost averaging strategies. Historical data: past U.S. stimulus rounds invested in crypto produced multi-hundred-percent gains for some investors. tariff distribution Bitcoin — Learn why investing a tariff check in Bitcoin can hedge inflation and capture growth. Read step-by-step guidance and key takeaways. What is a tariff distribution and how could Bitcoin benefit? tariff distribution Bitcoin refers to using tariff revenue to distribute cash payments to citizens. Investing that cash in Bitcoin can offer inflation protection, fractional exposure to a liquid global asset, and potential long-term capital appreciation compared with holding fiat. How would a $2,000 tariff distribution affect Bitcoin demand? A $2,000 distribution increases retail liquidity available for markets. Historical parallels: U.S. stimulus rounds in 2020–2021 saw an estimated portion of checks flow into stocks and crypto. A $1,200 stimulus invested in Bitcoin on April 11, 2020 (~$6,878 per BTC) would have harvested roughly 0.1744 BTC, worth about $21,270 at a later valuation—illustrating how modest amounts can compound. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Why investing a tariff distribution in Bitcoin could make sense\", \"alternativeHeadline\": \"How a Trump-era tariff distribution might be invested into Bitcoin\", \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-04T09:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-04T09:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/images/coinotag-logo.png\" } }, \"description\": \"An analysis of why directing tariff distribution payments into Bitcoin could be a practical hedge and investment strategy for Americans receiving $1,000–$2,000 payments.\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/article/tariff-distribution-bitcoin\" }} Why consider Bitcoin for a tariff-inspired payout? Bitcoin offers scarcity (21 million supply cap), global liquidity, and fractional ownership, enabling even $1,000 purchases to meaningfully participate in long-term market moves. For many investors, those attributes make Bitcoin a practical option for preserving purchasing power and pursuing growth. How did past stimulus payments impact crypto markets? Past U.S. stimulus checks coincided with crypto rallies. According to reports at the time, up to an estimated $40 billion of stimulus funds flowed into stocks and crypto.

Conservative savers should consider allocating a small portion of the distribution to Bitcoin while keeping emergency funds in cash and bonds. A modest allocation provides inflation exposure without overconcentration. Key Takeaways Small allocations can matter : Even $1,000–$2,000 buys fractional BTC with long-term upside potential. Historical precedent : Prior stimulus rounds saw material flows into crypto and stocks, producing significant gains for some holders. Security first : Use trusted custody solutions and best practices to protect holdings. Conclusion Redirecting a tariff distribution into Bitcoin can serve as a pragmatic hedge and growth tactic for Americans receiving $1,000–$2,000 checks.

        "body": "In the world of digital assets, momentum can shift in an instant. A single technical signal—especially on a higher-timeframe chart—can mark the difference between quiet consolidation and explosive upside. For XRP, that moment may be near. Analysts are closely monitoring the charts, where a rare combination of bullish signals is emerging, suggesting a potential price breakout could be imminent. Cryptoinsightuk Flags Bullish RSI Signal Market analyst Cryptoinsightuk has sounded the alarm for XRP holders, noting that the asset’s three-day chart is now showing a bullish Relative Strength Index (RSI) crossover alongside a strong three-day candle close. The analyst emphasized that this particular alignment has preceded major upward moves for XRP in the past—pointing to the last three instances on November 5, 2024, April 19, 2025, and June 27, 2025. We are in the territory where we could see a pop to the upside for $XRP at any point imo. We got a great 3 Day candle close yesterday and bullish cross on the 3 day RSI. Here are the last 3 times we saw this happen pic.twitter.com/NzPHCMjvqS — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) October 4, 2025 Each of those historical signals coincided with significant bullish momentum, suggesting the current setup could mark the beginning of another leg higher. “We are in the territory where we could see a pop to the upside for XRP at any point,” Cryptoinsightuk wrote, reinforcing that the chart structure remains technically constructive. Understanding the Technical Setup A bullish RSI crossover occurs when short-term momentum breaks above its longer-term trend line—an early indication that buying pressure is starting to dominate. When this signal appears on the three-day timeframe, it’s more significant than similar signals on shorter intervals because it indicates sustained market strength rather than short-term volatility. Coupled with the recent strong candle close, this crossover suggests that bulls are regaining control after a period of consolidation. Historically, such alignments on XRP’s chart have led to strong continuation rallies, provided they are confirmed by volume and price action in subsequent sessions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Resistance Levels and Market Context From a technical perspective, XRP faces its next resistance band between $3.20 and $3.65, a region that has repeatedly capped price advances in 2025. A decisive breakout and sustained close above that zone could unlock further upside momentum , potentially validating the “pop” scenario that traders like Cryptoinsightuk anticipate. Broader market conditions also favor bullish sentiment. Bitcoin remains strong above six-figure levels, overall liquidity has improved across digital assets, and institutional participation in on-chain settlement projects continues to grow. These factors collectively create an environment in which XRP could benefit from renewed investor confidence. Risk and Confirmation While optimism is building, analysts caution that no technical indicator guarantees results. RSI crossovers can produce false signals if volume fails to confirm or if sudden macro news shifts sentiment. Traders are advised to manage risk carefully, watch for volume-supported breakouts, and avoid over-leveraging positions during volatility spikes. The Bottom Line With momentum indicators in sync and historical patterns resurfacing, XRP seems poised for a potential breakout. As Cryptoinsightuk highlights, the market is once again positioned where a strong upward move could emerge at any time. Whether that surge materializes will depend on confirmation in the coming days—but for now, XRP sits squarely in what analysts call breakout territory .

Yet, even while Bitcoin solidifies its dominance, investors are tapping the market for opportunities with a higher return potential. This search has pushed MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale project already gaining momentum. With the speculation of a listing price of $0.007, community-driven growth has led to talk of bringing 100x ROI in less than a year. Bitcoin (BTC) Holds Strong at $122K and Technical Indicators Bitcoin has risen by 2% in the last 24 hours, trading at $122,300 at press time. This extends a 12% weekly gain. The move outperformed the market-wide 1.9% rise by the overall crypto sector, cementing this coin’s status as a trendsetter. Source: CoinMarketCap Institutional activity continues to gain ground for Bitcoin’s case. Public miners Marathon Digital and CleanSpark increased their treasuries in September. CleanSpark added 184 BTC, and Marathon increased reserves to 52,850 BTC, worth $6.4 billion. Disposal by both firms featured minimal sales and an emphasis on accumulation. By this strategy, the circulating supply is reduced, signaling confidence in a long-term value. Marathon’s expansion into AI and data infrastructure offers resilience to its operations. With several sources of revenue, the company does not heavily rely on the liquidation of BTC. Such institutional positioning gives credence to Bitcoin as a store of value. Retail adoption is another driver. Walmart-backed fintech OnePay announced plans to integrate Bitcoin trading to its mobile app by late 2025. With access to Walmart’s 150 million weekly customers, Bitcoin could have new use cases in retail payments. Enabling crypto-to-fiat conversions at checkout facilitates a payment bridge like Cash App’s, which historically led to increased transaction-driven adoption. From a technical point of view, Bitcoin has regained the $120K, moving above its 7-day SMA & 30-day EMA. The MACD histogram exploded to +688, its strongest signal since August highs. RSI is at 66.48, which indicates there is still momentum before overbought conditions develop. Analysts are targeting Fibonacci extensions at $124,451 and then $128,733 as the next resistance levels. Sustained closes above $122K may clear the path to retesting August’s record high near $125K. MAGACOIN FINANCE Forecast to Deliver 100x ROI by Next Year While Bitcoin’s climb reinforces its role as the market’s anchor, investors are increasingly turning their attention to opportunities with higher upside. That search has brought MAGACOIN FINANCE into the spotlight. Trading at a low price, the project is being hailed as one of 2025’s most promising tokens, with forecasts projecting a staggering 100x return by next year. The contrast is clear. Bitcoin offers stability and institutional adoption, but MAGACOIN FINANCE appeals to those seeking exponential growth. Speculation around a potential exchange listing has only amplified the excitement, suggesting that early participants could benefit from a surge in liquidity and demand once trading begins. Community momentum adds another dimension. Investor groups across Telegram and X have been buzzing with updates and coordinated buying strategies, echoing the grassroots energy that has fueled past breakout tokens. For many retail participants, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the kind of l ow-cost, high-reward opportunity that Bitcoin once offered in its early years. As Bitcoin tests resistance near $125K, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its own narrative, one centered on accessibility and the possibility of turning small allocations into transformative gains within the next cycle. Conclusion Bitcoin’s resilience underscores its strength as a dominant market force. With institutional miners accumulating, retail adoption expanding, and bullish technical indicators, the coin remains well-positioned for growth. However, the upside is moderated by its large market cap, making exponential returns less likely compared to smaller tokens. That is where MAGACOIN FINANCE steps in. With a forecasted $0.007 listing price and strong community engagement, it presents a unique opportunity for outsized returns. For investors balancing stability and growth potential, combining Bitcoin’s resilience with MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive trajectory may shape one of the most compelling strategies of 2025.

        "body": "Key Takeaways : The Celestia price prediction for 2025 suggests a maximum price of $21.22. By 2028, TIA could attain a maximum price of $64.46 and an average price of $56.11. In 2031, the TIA price forecast expects a maximum price of $156.88. Celestia generated significant interest before its October 2023 launch. This was largely due to the strong backing from major crypto exchanges from the outset and the intriguing technical concepts behind the Celestia modular blockchain network. In this article, we’ll provide a Celestia price prediction, analyze the factors driving these projections, and explore what the Celestia modular blockchain network brings to the broader crypto landscape.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price is attempting to hold below $1.5 as buyers lost confidence, resulting in a decline below Fib channels. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. It is advised to do own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile crypto market.

As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $1.2 and a maximum of $2.3, with an average of $1.8. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction October 2025 $1.2 $1.8 $2.3 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $1, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

        "body": "SOL is holding firm at $200 as it battles to stay afloat. Several factors suggest it could rebound soon. Besides Solana, two other projects are contending for dominance: Ripple (XRP) and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Each one of them is gaining significant attention in the crypto space. Their setup suggests that they could dominate in 2025. In this article, we will discuss each and find out which one will win in 2025. Solana (SOL): Institutional Magnet With Expanding On-Chain Utility Solana (SOL) trades near $203, after a pullback from earlier-month highs. However, on-chain activity remains robust. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) stands at around $13–14 billion, with healthy DEX and perpetual (perp) volumes supporting the network’s utility. Institutional flows have continued through the correction. The REX-Osprey Solana ETF experienced notable inflows of $65 million in mid-September, despite prices softening. Also, staking-oriented ETF products are expanding institutional access. Recent SEC rule changes have also lowered the bar for spot crypto ETFs, potentially accelerating product launches tied to SOL. Together, these factors suggest SOL could benefit if institutional allocation and on-chain demand persist. Ripple (XRP): Regulatory Clarity Meets Amidst Institutional Demand XRP trades near $2.80 as ETF optimism rises. It has recently partnered with DBS and Franklin Templeton to enable tokenized money-market fund trading on the XRP Ledger. This highlights institutional use cases beyond pure payments. The SEC’s September rule updates have also made multiple spot-ETF filings more feasible. This increases the odds of XRP-linked products and potential large inflows. Still, analysts caution that ETF approvals alone may not translate into sustained retail rallies unless institutional adoption leads to on-ledger volume and real-world flows. For instance, despite strong volume from the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF, XRP’s price has only fallen further below. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Culture Reinvented With Real Utility Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has positioned itself as a new frontier in meme tokens. It combines community-driven appeal with a solid technical foundation. Its presale, now in Stage 13, has already raised over $26.3 million and sold more than 16 billion tokens at $0.0022. This signals a strong early conviction among investors. Little Pepe is powered by Pepe Chain, an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 built for memes. The chain delivers low gas fees and fast finality. It also offers built-in protections against sniper bots. Its tokenomics are designed to reward sustainability. It includes zero buy/sell tax, staking mechanisms, and a share allocated for ecosystem growth. A key pillar is Pepe’s Pump Pad, the native launchpad that allows meme projects to deploy directly on the chain. Tokens launched via the pump pad help drive transaction volume, feeding demand back into LILPEPE itself. This creates a looping effect of utility and engagement. Credibility has been bolstered through a successful CertiK audit and listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. On the team side, Little Pepe is backed by anonymous experts with experience in meme project growth. This gives it a level of credibility that’s easily backed by its roadmap. Planned listings on two Tier-1 centralized exchanges at launch, along with future plans for the world’s largest exchange, could put LILPEPE in the spotlight as trading begins. Given its lower valuation, strong ecosystem design, and viral potential, Little Pepe may offer higher upside growth curves. SOL vs. XRP vs. LILPEPE: Which One Will Dominate in 2025? Solana offers institutional-grade security and broad infrastructure utilization. This makes it a reliable foundation for numerous blockchain applications. If demand for scalable smart contract platforms continues under regulatory clarity, SOL may capture substantial adoption. XRP’s strength lies in serving as a regulatory and institutional bridge—if legal frameworks favor financial token use cases, XRP could benefit strongly. Yet, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the wildcard. While SOL and XRP dominate with utility and legitimacy, LILPEPE blends memetic culture and core infrastructure, targeting the meme sector itself. In a cycle that may lean heavily on viral growth and novelty, LILPEPE could outperform in percentage gains. Analysts may see SOL capturing market share and XRP anchoring institutional flows. However, for raw upside, Little Pepe stands as the candidate with the most room to scale. Dominance depends on whether 2025 rewards infrastructure, regulation, or memetic innovation. And LILPEPE is best positioned if meme-utility fusion becomes the narrative. Conclusion Solana, Ripple, and Little Pepe each present a distinct path toward dominance in 2025. SOL combines infrastructure strength and adoption. On the other hand, XRP bridges financial legitimacy with crypto access. But it is Little Pepe that merges meme culture with technical depth, offering potentially explosive growth. Though it carries a higher risk, its robust presale performance, ecosystem development, and launchpad mechanics provide it with the framework to compete meaningfully. For investors seeking asymmetric upside in the meme sector, Little Pepe deserves serious consideration. Visit the Little Pepe website or join its Telegram to stay ahead of listings and developments.

        "url": "https://timestabloid.com/eric-trump-i-know-brad-garlinghouse-and-xrp-very-well/",
        "body": "A single podcast moment has sent ripples through both the political and crypto worlds. During a recent appearance on the PBD Podcast, Eric Trump made striking comments about his familiarity with Ripple, XRP, and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. The clip, shared by popular crypto influencer JackTheRippler on X, quickly gained momentum — fueling widespread discussion about the growing intersection between politics and digital finance. The conversation took place during the October 4, 2025, episode of the PBD Podcast, hosted by entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David. When asked how he felt about Dogecoin, XRP, Ripple, and Ethereum, Eric Trump’s candid response caught the attention of the crypto community. “I know them all extremely well. I know Brad very well, and XRP, he’s done a great job,” Trump said. JackTheRippler’s post featuring the clip has since gone viral, with thousands of reposts and comments from the XRP community. Many enthusiasts see Trump’s acknowledgment of Garlinghouse as a symbolic nod to Ripple’s growing relevance in global finance — especially as the company continues to recover from years of legal scrutiny and reposition itself for mainstream adoption. Eric Trump says that he knows Brad Garlinghouse and #XRP very well! pic.twitter.com/EK4bygBRLh — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 4, 2025 A Notable Moment for Ripple and XRP Ripple’s reputation has strengthened considerably in 2025 following the conclusion of its legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple has focused on scaling its payment infrastructure and expanding the reach of RLUSD. In this context, Eric Trump’s praise for Brad Garlinghouse carries additional weight. His words come at a time when institutional interest in blockchain payment systems is accelerating — and when the U.S. political landscape is increasingly open to discussing crypto innovation within regulated frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bridging Politics and Crypto Innovation Eric Trump’s remarks also highlight a broader trend: the mainstreaming of cryptocurrency within political and economic circles. His characterization of Bitcoin as “digital gold” and Ethereum as “financial oil” reflects an informed understanding of their roles within the digital economy. Yet, it was his personal acknowledgment of Brad Garlinghouse and XRP that truly resonated with investors, given Ripple’s established presence in institutional payment settlements. The moment signifies how figures within political leadership are beginning to publicly recognize the companies driving blockchain utility, not just speculative assets. In conclusion, while Eric Trump did not make any investment claims about XRP, his recognition of Brad Garlinghouse and Ripple stands as a noteworthy endorsement from a prominent political figure. The viral clip shared by JackTheRippler underscores how quickly influence, politics, and crypto narratives can converge — sometimes in just a few seconds of conversation. For Ripple and its supporters, those few words from the president’s son may have done more than spark social-media buzz; they reaffirmed that XRP’s name is now part of the mainstream financial dialogue.

A meme coin with momentum Little Pepe is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about Ethereum meme coins of 2025. The token’s presale has been moving at an incredible pace, with more than 16.15 billion of its 17.25 billion tokens already sold. The presale price recently increased from $0.0021 to $0.0022, reflecting steady demand. This is no small feat considering that Stage 1 investors are already sitting on 120% gains while the presale still has six stages left. The project’s momentum is further boosted by its recent listing on CoinMarketCap and a Certik audit score of 95.49%, which strengthens investor confidence. Being both audited and trackable on a significant platform gives LILPEPE credibility that most meme coins lack. Why investors are watching LILPEPE closely The appeal of Little Pepe goes beyond just hype. It is positioning itself as a Layer 2 meme ecosystem that offers zero trading tax, anti-sniper bot protection, and plans for a meme launchpad and NFT marketplace. These features suggest that it aims to be more than a fleeting trend. Community engagement has been high, with the Team running a $777,000 giveaway and introducing a Mega Giveaway worth over 15 ETH in prizes for top presale buyers from Stage 12 to Stage 17. At a time when crypto markets are searching for the next breakout star after Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, LILPEPE’s strong presale and active rewards are pulling in attention from across the meme coin crowd. How LILPEPE stacks up against the big names As of the time of writing, DOGE trades around $0.12 while SHIB hovers near $0.000018. These meme coins still have strong communities but lack the fresh momentum that drives rapid price surges. Little Pepe has stepped into that gap with a lower entry price and a roadmap that blends meme culture with practical tools. The fact that LILPEPE peaked above PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB in ChatGPT’s memecoin search trends between June and August 2025 hints at rising retail interest. The potential upside For investors entering at Stage 13’s $0.0022 price, the token is expected to launch at $0.0030, offering a near-term 36.36% gain even before its first day of open trading. Early-stage buyers have already seen 120% gains, and the speculative talk of a 75x rally reflects hopes that it can catch a fraction of the market cap of DOGE or SHIB as it gains mainstream attention. Final thoughts If you are looking for a fresh entry into the meme coin market and have $1,500 to spare, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is worth a closer look. It combines meme culture with credible tech and is already rewarding early participants. With the presale selling out fast at the time of writing and still offering projected gains of 36.36% before launch, this could be a rare chance to enter early. The presale is nearing its final stages, and as history has shown with other meme sensations, the early days often present the biggest growth window.

        "body": "The 2025 market is shaping up to be one of the most competitive in crypto history. Big names like Dogecoin and Solana are still drawing capital, but a newcomer, Little Pepe, is quietly stacking numbers that hint at far greater upside. Here’s how each project positions itself and why one could realistically deliver 45x gains. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Energy With Real Tech Underneath Little Pepe (LILPEPE) isn’t just another token riding Ethereum’s coattails. It’s building its own Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 network that handles transactions cheaply and at scale. Think of it as a meme coin with the backbone of a serious blockchain. The presale tells the story. With a hard cap of 100 billion tokens, 26.5 billion are set aside for early buyers. Stage 13 is live at $0.0022; more than 16.15 billion tokens have already been sold, pulling in $26.36 million. Stage 14 will tick up to $0.0023, a 120% jump from the starting price of $0.001. Early participants have already locked in triple-digit paper gains before a single exchange listing. Every presale round has increased the price. Stage 1 raised $500K at $0.001, Stage 2 climbed to $0.0011 for $1.325 million, Stage 3 reached $0.0012 for $2.5 million, creating a built-in momentum machine that rewards early conviction. Why Investors Are Taking Notice Little Pepe isn’t just relying on hype. Its feature set is designed to solve real issues in the meme coin space. There’s zero trading tax, so holders keep every bit of their gains. Sniper-bot protection ensures a fairer launch and less manipulation, and staking functionality enables long-term investors to earn passive income. Yet the most interesting element is the Meme Launchpad, an incubator that natively enables emerging meme projects to launch within the Little Pepe ecosystem. With DAO-based governance, NFT integration, and cross-chain compatibility on the roadmap in the future, the project is building foundations that could extend far beyond its current Layer 2 focus. To keep the community buzzing, the team has stacked giveaways. The headline is a $777,000 presale prize pool , with ten winners taking home $77,000 each, and a minimum buy-in of just $100. A separate Mega Giveaway across Stages 12–17 adds over 15 ETH in rewards, split between top buyers and random participants. Few meme projects have aggressively combined hype, utility, and incentive structures. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Original Meme Giant Faces New Challenges Dogecoin still holds cultural sway, but its momentum has certainly slowed. DOGE has not returned to the heights of around $0.74, and subsequent corrections in 2025 have tempered investors’ expectations. All that could change with the recently launched Rex-Osprey Dogecoin ETF, which could introduce institutional money into the picture and potentially drive DOGE to $0.40 or even $1. Still, the days of 100x returns are likely behind it. As the meme coin landscape shifts toward projects with stronger utility and more robust ecosystems, Dogecoin’s once-unassailable throne looks more vulnerable than ever. Solana (SOL): The Backbone of DeFi’s Next Wave Solana remains one of the most essential blockchains in the Web3 space and for good reason. It can process thousands of transactions per second at minimal cost and become the go-to network for lending platforms, NFT marketplaces, and DeFi protocols. If adoption keeps climbing at the current pace, analysts predict a price range of $500–$750 by 2030, particularly as institutional capital continues to pour in. Solana’s Firedancer will continue to enhance stability, solidifying Solana as a foundational layer for the next generation of dApps. Bottom Line Dogecoin and Solana offer proven ecosystems and the comfort of established networks, but their upside is capped. Little Pepe , still priced at just $0.0022, sits where past giants once stood, early, hungry, and built to scale. If its Layer-2 tech, launchpad, and aggressive presale strategy keep gaining traction, a 45x move isn’t a fantasy. The window to grab LILPEPE under a quarter of a cent is barely open for investors chasing the next breakout before the market wakes up.

        "body": "Solana (SOL) is trading at $227.69, holding steady after a week of heavy institutional inflows and rising market confidence. On-chain and derivatives data indicate a significant shift in market structure; institutions are becoming increasingly convinced, while retail remains cautious. Velo.data shows Solana futures open interest (OI) on CME has reached an all-time high of $2.16 billion, as price has rebounded 23% from $195 to $235. This institutional positioning is ahead of the Oct 10 SEC decision on a Solana based ETF. Timing suggests pros are positioning for a volatility spike. SOL CME futures data. Source: Velo.data CME’s annualized basis is 16.37%, down from 35% in July, so it’s not speculative. Retail OI across exchanges is flat and funding rates are near neutral. This is a clear picture — institutions are buying strength while retail is still recovering from the $307 million in liquidations on Sept 22, when longs worth $250 million were wiped out. This is a balanced yet bullish setup — institutional accumulation is building a base, while retail leverage remains low. Historically, this type of structure has led to a measured move up, rather than a blow-off top. Solana ETP Inflows Reinforce Confidence Another sign of institutional demand is the inflow into Solana ETPs. Total Solana ETP AUM has surpassed $500 million , led by the Solana Staking ETF (SSK) from REXShares, which has over $400 million AUM. The Bitwise Solana Staking ETP (BSOL) has surpassed $100 million in AUM, and both products have proliferated since their launch. This represents a structural shift in how investors gain exposure to Solana — from speculative trading to regulated products that offer yield-bearing exposure through staking. This is a sign of market maturity and confirms Solana is one of the most accumulated altcoins in 2025. These inflows also tighten up liquidity on the spot market, supporting price as supply on exchanges declines. With CME’s record futures activity, this means institutional positioning is increasingly driving the price of Solana. Solana Price Prediction – Technical Outlook Technically, Solana price prediction remains bullish as SOL is in a defined uptrend, trading at $227 after moving up from $205 last week. The 50 SMA ($214.50) and 100 SMA ($216.35) are below the price, indicating a bullish crossover and an intact trend. Candlesticks show smaller-bodied candles with upper wicks, consolidation after a big move. RSI is 55.9, so the market has cooled off and there’s room for another push higher. Resistance is at $237.00, then $244.85, with a potential target at $253.44 if momentum continues. For traders, the optimal setup is between $224 and $225, where the lower channel serves as a buy-the-dip zone. As long as Solana is above its moving averages, the broader bias is bullish, so SOL should be positioned for a breakout to new all-time highs in the coming months.

Bitcoin offers fractional ownership, wide liquidity, and a proven long-term return profile that has turned small stimulus allocations into substantial gains over multi‑year windows. Immediate hedge against inflation: Bitcoin is often used as a store-of-value alternative to cash. Small allocations (e.g., $1,000–$2,000) buy fractional BTC and fit dollar-cost averaging strategies. Historical data: past U.S. stimulus rounds invested in crypto produced multi-hundred-percent gains for some investors. tariff distribution Bitcoin — Learn why investing a tariff check in Bitcoin can hedge inflation and capture growth. Read step-by-step guidance and key takeaways. What is a tariff distribution and how could Bitcoin benefit? tariff distribution Bitcoin refers to using tariff revenue to distribute cash payments to citizens. Investing that cash in Bitcoin can offer inflation protection, fractional exposure to a liquid global asset, and potential long-term capital appreciation compared with holding fiat. How would a $2,000 tariff distribution affect Bitcoin demand? A $2,000 distribution increases retail liquidity available for markets. Historical parallels: U.S. stimulus rounds in 2020–2021 saw an estimated portion of checks flow into stocks and crypto. A $1,200 stimulus invested in Bitcoin on April 11, 2020 (~$6,878 per BTC) would have harvested roughly 0.1744 BTC, worth about $21,270 at a later valuation—illustrating how modest amounts can compound. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Why investing a tariff distribution in Bitcoin could make sense\", \"alternativeHeadline\": \"How a Trump-era tariff distribution might be invested into Bitcoin\", \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-04T09:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-04T09:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/images/coinotag-logo.png\" } }, \"description\": \"An analysis of why directing tariff distribution payments into Bitcoin could be a practical hedge and investment strategy for Americans receiving $1,000–$2,000 payments.\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/article/tariff-distribution-bitcoin\" }} Why consider Bitcoin for a tariff-inspired payout? Bitcoin offers scarcity (21 million supply cap), global liquidity, and fractional ownership, enabling even $1,000 purchases to meaningfully participate in long-term market moves. For many investors, those attributes make Bitcoin a practical option for preserving purchasing power and pursuing growth. How did past stimulus payments impact crypto markets? Past U.S. stimulus checks coincided with crypto rallies. According to reports at the time, up to an estimated $40 billion of stimulus funds flowed into stocks and crypto. Example: investing the initial $1,200 stimulus in April 2020 into Bitcoin (~$6,878) would have resulted in significant percentage gains over subsequent years. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to invest a tariff distribution into Bitcoin\", \"description\": \"Step-by-step guidance for allocating a $1,000–$2,000 tariff distribution into Bitcoin safely and strategically.\", \"totalTime\": \"PT30M\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Decide allocation\", \"text\": \"Choose a conservative percentage of the distribution to allocate to Bitcoin (for example 25%–50%).\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Select a wallet or exchange\", \"text\": \"Use a reputable custodial platform or a self-custody wallet to hold Bitcoin securely.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Purchase Bitcoin\", \"text\": \"Buy fractional Bitcoin using dollar-cost averaging or a lump-sum, depending on your risk profile.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Review and secure\", \"text\": \"Transfer to cold storage if long-term holding; enable strong security measures such as two-factor authentication.\" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Should I put my tariff distribution into Bitcoin?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Putting all or part of a tariff distribution into Bitcoin can provide inflation resistance and growth potential, but it should match your risk tolerance and financial goals.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How much BTC could a $2,000 payout buy?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"At current prices a $2,000 payout buys fractional Bitcoin (for example roughly 0.0165 BTC at a hypothetical price), enabling exposure without needing a full coin.\" } } ]} Should retirees or conservative savers use a tariff distribution to buy Bitcoin? Conservative savers should consider allocating a small portion of the distribution to Bitcoin while keeping emergency funds in cash and bonds. A modest allocation provides inflation exposure without overconcentration. Key Takeaways Small allocations can matter : Even $1,000–$2,000 buys fractional BTC with long-term upside potential. Historical precedent : Prior stimulus rounds saw material flows into crypto and stocks, producing significant gains for some holders. Security first : Use trusted custody solutions and best practices to protect holdings. Conclusion Redirecting a tariff distribution into Bitcoin can serve as a pragmatic hedge and growth tactic for Americans receiving $1,000–$2,000 checks. COINOTAG recommends weighing personal risk tolerance, using secure custody, and considering dollar-cost averaging to integrate cryptocurrency exposure responsibly. Published: 2025-10-04 — COINOTAG",

Technical analysis shows consolidation between $2.60–$3.20; a confirmed move above $3.20 suggests bullish continuation.

XRP spot ETF delayed by SEC shutdown; watch $3.20 confirmation and $3.90–$4.60 breakout targets. Read analysis and next steps. XRP faces ETF delays from the SEC shutdown while Elliott Wave charts show bullish breakout potential, keeping traders watchful of momentum. XRP’s spot ETF launch remains stalled as the SEC shutdown delays approvals, leaving investors balancing regulation risks and market momentum. Elliott Wave analysis shows XRP consolidating between $2.60 and $3.20 with bullish targets eyeing $3.90 and $4.60 on breakout strength. Market confidence in XRP now depends on both regulatory clarity and bullish confirmation, highlighting execution as the driver of growth. What is causing the XRP spot ETF delay? XRP spot ETF approvals are delayed because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) scaled back operations during the government shutdown on October 1, 2025. The pause prevents the SEC from completing approvals, leaving spot ETF listings on hold until regulators resume full capacity. How does the SEC shutdown affect ETF launches? The shutdown halts active review and finalization of ETF listings. Journalist Eleanor Terrett noted that the Teucrium $XRP ETF structure involved Treasuries and swap receivables and was registered differently; however, spot ETFs require explicit SEC approval under the 33 Act. Industry observers, including Chad Steingraber, pointed out procedural deadlines that resulted in automatic allowance for some filings, but overall clarity and active approvals remain suspended. Technical outlook: Where could XRP move next? Analysts using Elliott Wave and pattern analysis see XRP trading in a triangular consolidation range between $2.60 and $3.20. A confirmed close above $3.20 is widely viewed as the first bullish confirmation and could set targets at $3.90 and $4.60 . What are the support and resistance levels to watch? Key levels identified by technical analysts include support at $2.33–$2.60 and resistance/confirmation near $3.20. A corrective dip toward $2.33 remains possible, but a validated breakout would shift momentum in favor of buyers. XRP key price levels and targets Level Role Comment $2.33 Lower support Correction risk if wave E completes $2.60–$3.20 Consolidation Triangle formation; watch for breakdown or breakout $3.20 Buy confirmation Close above signals bullish continuation $3.90 / $4.60 Targets Measured breakout objectives from Elliott Wave analysis Why are traders balancing regulation and momentum? Regulatory uncertainty can mute ETF-driven capital flows even when technical setups look constructive. Traders therefore monitor both SEC operational status and price confirmation levels to gauge potential inflows and execution risk. How should traders manage risk while waiting? Traders typically use staged entries and clear stop levels: 1) Wait for a daily close above $3.20 for confirmation; 2) Use a protective stop below the $2.60 support zone; 3) Size positions according to volatility and regulatory news flow. Source: DustyBC Crypto Frequently Asked Questions Will the SEC shutdown permanently block XRP spot ETFs? No. The shutdown pauses active approvals but does not represent a policy rejection. Approvals resume when the SEC operates normally and completes its review processes. When should traders expect clarity on ETF timelines? Timelines depend on the duration of the shutdown and the SEC’s backlog. Market participants should plan for updates once the agency resumes full activity and posts formal notices. Key Takeaways Regulatory pause: The SEC shutdown delays spot ETF approvals and stalls ETF-driven inflows. Technical setup: XRP consolidates between $2.60–$3.20; a daily close above $3.20 would be a bullish trigger. Actionable plan: Monitor SEC status, confirm breakout above $3.20, and manage risk with stops near $2.60. Conclusion Execution, not speculation, will determine XRP’s near-term trajectory. While the SEC shutdown delays potential spot ETF launches, Elliott Wave and pattern analysis show clear breakout levels to monitor. Traders should wait for regulatory clarity and technical confirmation before increasing exposure.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/polygon-price-prediction/",
        "body": "Key Takeaways : POL price faces a bearish pressure toward $0.237. Polygon price prediction for 2025 expects the price of POL to surge toward $1.57. By 2031, we expect the POL price to record a maximum price of $13.01. Polygon, an Ethereum side chain and layer two scaling solution, has experienced substantial uptake by enterprises and industries in the last year. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, POL. This raises the question: Can POL’s price reach $10? This forecast for Polygon’s price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the POL price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polygon Ticker Symbol POL Rank 43 Current Price $0.237 Price change 24H -0.48% Market cap $2.15 Billion Circulating supply 10.44 Billion POL Trading volume 24h $101.67 Million (+9.5%) All-time high $1.29, March 14, 2024 All-time low $0.1533, April 7, 2025 POL price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.237 Price Prediction $ 0.258038 (8.21%) Fear & Greed Index 63 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.00% Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.250239 200-Day SMA $ 0.232289 14-Day RSI 48.12 Polygon technical analysis: POL price faces bearish pressure toward $0.237 POL price analysis shows a bearish pressure toward $0.237 Resistance for POL is present at $0.2662 Support for POL/USD is present at $0.2130 The POL price analysis for 4 October confirms that POL faces increasing volatility as it declines toward $0.237. Currently, the bulls are aiming for a recovery. POL price analysis 1-day chart: Polygon faces selling pressure toward $0.237 POL price is facing a decline as sellers push the price toward $0.237. POL price is aiming for a hold below the immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume declined toward $10 million, showing decreased interest in trading activity. The price is trading at $0.237, declining over 0.48% in the last 24 hours. POLUSDT chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level but currently hovers around 47, showing that bears are aiming to control price momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. POL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA trend lines The 4-hour POL price chart suggests POL continues to experience bullish activity around EMA lines, creating a positive sentiment on the price chart. As the price continues to face resistance near the Fib level, bears prepare for a domination by holding the price below the EMA20 trend line. POLUSDT chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.6, hinting that buyers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost an upward correction. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening bearish positions.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the POL price from an immediate surge. However, if POL’s price successfully breaks above $0.2662, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.2985. POLUSDT chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, POL’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.2130, resulting in a correction to $0.1650. Is POL a good investment? POL token can be a good investment option in the long run as the project develops a roadmap for its Polygon 2.0 version. Polygon collaborates with diverse industries to enhance adoption, focusing on NFT solutions and Ethereum scalability. Partnerships include Starbucks for an NFT loyalty program and collaborations with Adidas, Prada, and Disney to develop NFT offerings. Why is the POL price down today? Following overall buying demand in the market, POL price faced increased bullish pressure around the $0.25 level. However, lack of buying demand around higher levels resulted in a bearish pressure. What is the POL price prediction for 2025? The Polygon price prediction for 2025 expects the POL price to record a maximum level of $1.57. Will POL price touch $1? Yes, POL price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2025. However, this depends on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will POL Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and POL gains regulatory recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2030. Is POL a good long-term investment? As Polygon continues to expand its offerings, it gains a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, POL can be a good long-term investment option.

We expect POL to record a minimum price of $0.22 and a maximum price of $0.35, with an average of $0.27 in October. POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction October 2025 $0.22 $0.27 $0.35 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $0.15. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

        "body": "Following the US government shutdown, claims spread rapidly on social media that some cryptocurrency ETFs, particularly an XRP ETF, were automatically approved due to the restrictions placed on securities regulator SEC operations. These claims, which spread on social media, claimed that the XRP ETF application prepared by Teucrium was not directly approved by the SEC, but was “automatically activated” because the decision period had expired. Cryptocurrency journalist Eleanor Terrett clarified these claims, stating that this was a misinterpretation. According to Terrett, Teucrium's XRP ETF falls under Section 40 (Investment Company Act of 1940) because it is structured around Treasury bonds, cash, and derivative receivables. These types of ETFs don't require an active SEC approval process; the product automatically becomes active once the application period is over. Related News: Tether Moves to Purchase $200 Million Worth of Its Own Altcoin on the Market Terrett also noted that futures-based ETFs generally go through the same process, but spot crypto ETFs are completely different. Because spot ETFs are registered as “commodity trusts” under Section 33 of the Securities Act of 1933, they require explicit SEC approval to trade. Therefore, spot crypto ETFs like LTC, SOL, or XRP cannot be automatically approved or begin trading while the government shutdown continues. The SEC must resume full operations and review S-1 filings. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Claims Spread That XRP Spot ETF Was Automatically Approved: How True Is It?",

        "body": "Bitcoin continues to draw global attention as analysts keep projecting new highs before the end of the year. With institutional accumulation and retail adoption increasing, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is still set for further growth. Forecasts indicate that Bitcoin could soon clear resistance zones last seen in August, which is promising for the entire crypto sector. Yet, even while Bitcoin solidifies its dominance, investors are tapping the market for opportunities with a higher return potential. This search has pushed MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale project already gaining momentum. With the speculation of a listing price of $0.007, community-driven growth has led to talk of bringing 100x ROI in less than a year. Bitcoin (BTC) Holds Strong at $122K and Technical Indicators Bitcoin has risen by 2% in the last 24 hours, trading at $122,300 at press time. This extends a 12% weekly gain. The move outperformed the market-wide 1.9% rise by the overall crypto sector, cementing this coin’s status as a trendsetter. Source: CoinMarketCap Institutional activity continues to gain ground for Bitcoin’s case. Public miners Marathon Digital and CleanSpark increased their treasuries in September. CleanSpark added 184 BTC, and Marathon increased reserves to 52,850 BTC, worth $6.4 billion. Disposal by both firms featured minimal sales and an emphasis on accumulation. By this strategy, the circulating supply is reduced, signaling confidence in a long-term value. Marathon’s expansion into AI and data infrastructure offers resilience to its operations. With several sources of revenue, the company does not heavily rely on the liquidation of BTC. Such institutional positioning gives credence to Bitcoin as a store of value. Retail adoption is another driver. Walmart-backed fintech OnePay announced plans to integrate Bitcoin trading to its mobile app by late 2025. With access to Walmart’s 150 million weekly customers, Bitcoin could have new use cases in retail payments. Enabling crypto-to-fiat conversions at checkout facilitates a payment bridge like Cash App’s, which historically led to increased transaction-driven adoption. From a technical point of view, Bitcoin has regained the $120K, moving above its 7-day SMA & 30-day EMA. The MACD histogram exploded to +688, its strongest signal since August highs. RSI is at 66.48, which indicates there is still momentum before overbought conditions develop. Analysts are targeting Fibonacci extensions at $124,451 and then $128,733 as the next resistance levels. Sustained closes above $122K may clear the path to retesting August’s record high near $125K. MAGACOIN FINANCE Forecast to Deliver 100x ROI by Next Year While Bitcoin’s climb reinforces its role as the market’s anchor, investors are increasingly turning their attention to opportunities with higher upside. That search has brought MAGACOIN FINANCE into the spotlight. Trading at a low price, the project is being hailed as one of 2025’s most promising tokens, with forecasts projecting a staggering 100x return by next year. The contrast is clear. Bitcoin offers stability and institutional adoption, but MAGACOIN FINANCE appeals to those seeking exponential growth. Speculation around a potential exchange listing has only amplified the excitement, suggesting that early participants could benefit from a surge in liquidity and demand once trading begins. Community momentum adds another dimension. Investor groups across Telegram and X have been buzzing with updates and coordinated buying strategies, echoing the grassroots energy that has fueled past breakout tokens. For many retail participants, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the kind of l ow-cost, high-reward opportunity that Bitcoin once offered in its early years. As Bitcoin tests resistance near $125K, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its own narrative, one centered on accessibility and the possibility of turning small allocations into transformative gains within the next cycle. Conclusion Bitcoin’s resilience underscores its strength as a dominant market force. With institutional miners accumulating, retail adoption expanding, and bullish technical indicators, the coin remains well-positioned for growth. However, the upside is moderated by its large market cap, making exponential returns less likely compared to smaller tokens. That is where MAGACOIN FINANCE steps in. With a forecasted $0.007 listing price and strong community engagement, it presents a unique opportunity for outsized returns. For investors balancing stability and growth potential, combining Bitcoin’s resilience with MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive trajectory may shape one of the most compelling strategies of 2025.

        "body": "SOL is holding firm at $200 as it battles to stay afloat. Several factors suggest it could rebound soon. Besides Solana, two other projects are contending for dominance: Ripple (XRP) and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Each one of them is gaining significant attention in the crypto space. Their setup suggests that they could dominate in 2025. In this article, we will discuss each and find out which one will win in 2025. Solana (SOL): Institutional Magnet With Expanding On-Chain Utility Solana (SOL) trades near $203, after a pullback from earlier-month highs. However, on-chain activity remains robust. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) stands at around $13–14 billion, with healthy DEX and perpetual (perp) volumes supporting the network’s utility. Institutional flows have continued through the correction. The REX-Osprey Solana ETF experienced notable inflows of $65 million in mid-September, despite prices softening. Also, staking-oriented ETF products are expanding institutional access. Recent SEC rule changes have also lowered the bar for spot crypto ETFs, potentially accelerating product launches tied to SOL. Together, these factors suggest SOL could benefit if institutional allocation and on-chain demand persist. Ripple (XRP): Regulatory Clarity Meets Amidst Institutional Demand XRP trades near $2.80 as ETF optimism rises. It has recently partnered with DBS and Franklin Templeton to enable tokenized money-market fund trading on the XRP Ledger. This highlights institutional use cases beyond pure payments. The SEC’s September rule updates have also made multiple spot-ETF filings more feasible. This increases the odds of XRP-linked products and potential large inflows. Still, analysts caution that ETF approvals alone may not translate into sustained retail rallies unless institutional adoption leads to on-ledger volume and real-world flows. For instance, despite strong volume from the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF, XRP’s price has only fallen further below. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Culture Reinvented With Real Utility Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has positioned itself as a new frontier in meme tokens. It combines community-driven appeal with a solid technical foundation. Its presale, now in Stage 13, has already raised over $26.3 million and sold more than 16 billion tokens at $0.0022. This signals a strong early conviction among investors. Little Pepe is powered by Pepe Chain, an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 built for memes. The chain delivers low gas fees and fast finality. It also offers built-in protections against sniper bots. Its tokenomics are designed to reward sustainability. It includes zero buy/sell tax, staking mechanisms, and a share allocated for ecosystem growth. A key pillar is Pepe’s Pump Pad, the native launchpad that allows meme projects to deploy directly on the chain. Tokens launched via the pump pad help drive transaction volume, feeding demand back into LILPEPE itself. This creates a looping effect of utility and engagement. Credibility has been bolstered through a successful CertiK audit and listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. On the team side, Little Pepe is backed by anonymous experts with experience in meme project growth. This gives it a level of credibility that’s easily backed by its roadmap. Planned listings on two Tier-1 centralized exchanges at launch, along with future plans for the world’s largest exchange, could put LILPEPE in the spotlight as trading begins. Given its lower valuation, strong ecosystem design, and viral potential, Little Pepe may offer higher upside growth curves. SOL vs. XRP vs. LILPEPE: Which One Will Dominate in 2025? Solana offers institutional-grade security and broad infrastructure utilization. This makes it a reliable foundation for numerous blockchain applications. If demand for scalable smart contract platforms continues under regulatory clarity, SOL may capture substantial adoption. XRP’s strength lies in serving as a regulatory and institutional bridge—if legal frameworks favor financial token use cases, XRP could benefit strongly. Yet, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the wildcard. While SOL and XRP dominate with utility and legitimacy, LILPEPE blends memetic culture and core infrastructure, targeting the meme sector itself. In a cycle that may lean heavily on viral growth and novelty, LILPEPE could outperform in percentage gains. Analysts may see SOL capturing market share and XRP anchoring institutional flows. However, for raw upside, Little Pepe stands as the candidate with the most room to scale. Dominance depends on whether 2025 rewards infrastructure, regulation, or memetic innovation. And LILPEPE is best positioned if meme-utility fusion becomes the narrative. Conclusion Solana, Ripple, and Little Pepe each present a distinct path toward dominance in 2025. SOL combines infrastructure strength and adoption. On the other hand, XRP bridges financial legitimacy with crypto access. But it is Little Pepe that merges meme culture with technical depth, offering potentially explosive growth. Though it carries a higher risk, its robust presale performance, ecosystem development, and launchpad mechanics provide it with the framework to compete meaningfully. For investors seeking asymmetric upside in the meme sector, Little Pepe deserves serious consideration. Visit the Little Pepe website or join its Telegram to stay ahead of listings and developments.

        "body": "A single podcast moment has sent ripples through both the political and crypto worlds. During a recent appearance on the PBD Podcast, Eric Trump made striking comments about his familiarity with Ripple, XRP, and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. The clip, shared by popular crypto influencer JackTheRippler on X, quickly gained momentum — fueling widespread discussion about the growing intersection between politics and digital finance. The conversation took place during the October 4, 2025, episode of the PBD Podcast, hosted by entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David. When asked how he felt about Dogecoin, XRP, Ripple, and Ethereum, Eric Trump’s candid response caught the attention of the crypto community. “I know them all extremely well. I know Brad very well, and XRP, he’s done a great job,” Trump said. JackTheRippler’s post featuring the clip has since gone viral, with thousands of reposts and comments from the XRP community. Many enthusiasts see Trump’s acknowledgment of Garlinghouse as a symbolic nod to Ripple’s growing relevance in global finance — especially as the company continues to recover from years of legal scrutiny and reposition itself for mainstream adoption. Eric Trump says that he knows Brad Garlinghouse and #XRP very well! pic.twitter.com/EK4bygBRLh — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 4, 2025 A Notable Moment for Ripple and XRP Ripple’s reputation has strengthened considerably in 2025 following the conclusion of its legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple has focused on scaling its payment infrastructure and expanding the reach of RLUSD. In this context, Eric Trump’s praise for Brad Garlinghouse carries additional weight. His words come at a time when institutional interest in blockchain payment systems is accelerating — and when the U.S. political landscape is increasingly open to discussing crypto innovation within regulated frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bridging Politics and Crypto Innovation Eric Trump’s remarks also highlight a broader trend: the mainstreaming of cryptocurrency within political and economic circles. His characterization of Bitcoin as “digital gold” and Ethereum as “financial oil” reflects an informed understanding of their roles within the digital economy. Yet, it was his personal acknowledgment of Brad Garlinghouse and XRP that truly resonated with investors, given Ripple’s established presence in institutional payment settlements. The moment signifies how figures within political leadership are beginning to publicly recognize the companies driving blockchain utility, not just speculative assets. In conclusion, while Eric Trump did not make any investment claims about XRP, his recognition of Brad Garlinghouse and Ripple stands as a noteworthy endorsement from a prominent political figure. The viral clip shared by JackTheRippler underscores how quickly influence, politics, and crypto narratives can converge — sometimes in just a few seconds of conversation. For Ripple and its supporters, those few words from the president’s son may have done more than spark social-media buzz; they reaffirmed that XRP’s name is now part of the mainstream financial dialogue.

        "body": "As Solana (SOL) matures, the rapid short-term gains it once offered are becoming harder to replicate. The early-day investors who saw $200 turn into $5,000 have largely exited that window. Newer entrants in 2025 are looking at high-utility early-stage projects and still provide explosive upside. A crypto that already provides such an opportunity is Little Pepe (LILPEPE)—a meme coin that has a real-life blockchain application. Having sold a record presale and increasing token price, Little Pepe is coming out as a top choice. Little Pepe: Ethereum Layer 2, Zero Tax, Staking, and DAO Governance Little Pepe is an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 blockchain with a combination of meme culture and real utility. The project features staking rewards, voting in the DAO, and launching memes, and zero taxation is applied to the trading. Future integrations are NFTs and cross-chain compatibility, expanding its possible application. The LILPEPE ecosystem will be designed to ensure that there is a balance between liquidity, reserves, staking, marketing and CEX preparedness with a total supply of 100 billion tokens. $26.3M raised so far: a clear presale trajectory Since launching its presale on June 10, Little Pepe has advanced through 13 stages, steadily increasing in value. Stage 1 began at $0.001, with subsequent stages climbing by $0.0001 per phase. By Stage 13, now active, the token price has reached $0.0022. To date, $26,382,101 has been raised out of a $28,775,000 target. A total of 16,162,317,775 tokens have already been sold from the 17,250,000,000 allocation. Stage 14 will introduce yet another uptick at $0.0023, which will be a 130% increase compared to the price of Stage 1. This continued flow has placed early investors near breakeven or gaining even before the presale ends, thus showing strong momentum and interest. $777,000 giveaway now live for presale contributors A $777,000 giveaway is currently live to celebrate the presale. Ten winners will receive $77,000 each in $LILPEPE tokens. To enter, participants must contribute at least $100 to the ongoing presale. The promotion is active during presale stages only and also includes random big buyer rewards (15+ ETH) between Stages 12 and 17. Little Pepe presents a new investment window that mirrors the early Solana days. The project shows actual blockchain value with a fast-moving presale, the Layer 2 architecture, zero tax on trading, staking, governance of the project through DAOs, and future NFTs. According to the present momentum and tokenomics, LILPEPE has all the potential to become one of the most successful crypto assets in 2025.

Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price is attempting to hold below $1.5 as buyers lost confidence, resulting in a decline below Fib channels. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. It is advised to do own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile crypto market.

How could SOL move before the next leg up? SOL could retest $200 if the $200–$220 long cluster is flushed.

NRPL flipped red at the back end of September as price broke below $224, triggering roughly $1.7 billion in realized losses and accelerating sell-side pressure. Massive profit-taking followed the run-up: on 2 October, nearly $1.03 billion in SOL were realized around $234, meaning approximately 4.4 million SOL changed hands. The immediate reaction pushed SOL down to $228 (about -2.5%), showing the resistance wall at $230 struggled to absorb selling. On-chain distribution matters: around 5% of supply remains clustered at $224. With $200 million in overexposed longs concentrated in the $200–$220 range, the risk of a move toward $200 remains material if bids fail. Source: TradingView (SOL/USDT) The market is shrugging off rotational bids, and on-chain data shows investors avoiding altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index fell four points to 67 at press time, highlighting muted risk appetite and constrained alt flows. After capitulation, SOL bounced ~18.5% off $200, with bulls briefly turning $200 into support and testing $230. But resistance around $230 remains a near-term ceiling unless rotational buying and fresh bids return. Source: Glassnode Frequently Asked Questions Could SOL test $200 again this quarter? Yes. If $230 resistance holds and the $200–$220 long cluster is flushed, SOL could retest $200. A sustained reclaim of $200 by bulls is needed to resume a bullish trajectory toward $250–$300. What on-chain metrics signal capitulation? Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) flips, large realized-loss events (~$1.7 billion in this episode) and concentrated supply at specific price points (e.g., 5% at $224) are classic capitulation signals. Key Takeaways Resistance weakness : Heavy profit-taking near $234 weakened the $230 resistance and removed buying momentum. Support vulnerability : $200 is critical; $200–$220 long clusters ($200M) raise retest risk. Actionable insight : Traders should monitor NRPL, realized volumes, and order-book bids around $200 before adding exposure. Conclusion Solana resistance at $230 is under pressure as realized profits and concentrated long liquidity increase downside risk. Watch on-chain NRPL, realized-loss events and the $200–$220 long cluster for clues; if $200 holds, SOL could clear weak hands and target higher levels in Q4.

        "body": "Crypto analyst Bobby revealed that the XRP price has completed a consolidation pattern, hinting at a potential parabolic rally for the altcoin soon. The analyst suggested that XRP’s price could rally to double digits once this rally occurs. XRP Price Eyes Rally To $19 As It Completes Double-Bottom Pattern In an X post, Bobby indicated that the XRP price has completed the macro double-bottom pattern, which it had spent over seven years building. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the altcoin is now gearing up for a rally to as high as $19 following the completion of this consolidation pattern. Related Reading: XRP Price Faces 25% Drawdown Risk, But This Technical Point Is Key Meanwhile, the analyst noted that the XRP price spent over nine months building support near the neckline of the massive W pattern. He added that the altcoin spent the same amount of time consolidating below the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of its latest macro swing high to swing low. Bobby indicated that the XRP price rally will begin once it breaks through $3.02 and gains monthly acceptance above that level. He expects this move to take XRP into the take-profit levels he has highlighted on several occasions. These levels include $4.7, $6.4, $7.4, and possibly $19, all of which mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for the altcoin. The analyst also predicts that the XRP ETFs could spark a rally to between $8 and $13 with possible wicks into the $20 range. These funds are expected to launch this month, depending on when the U.S. government shutdown ends. They provided a bullish outlook for XRP due to the amount of inflows that they could drive into the altcoin’s ecosystem. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that Bobby had also earlier alluded to previous cycles as the reason XRP could rally to $13. Analyst Sounds Warning To Bulls Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has warned XRP bulls that the XRP price needs to close above $3.13 to $3.20 on the 3-day chart to sustain the current bullish momentum. His warning followed XRP’s reclaim of the psychological $3 level, which he noted has wrecked the bears. However, the altcoin needs to close above this range, or the bulls are also in danger of getting wrecked. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Remains Bullish As This Level Holds Egrag Crypto stated that the XRP price could follow suit if Bitcoin and Ethereum get rejected on their current rallies. He added that the altcoin could head lower, which he believes might actually be better. He assured that the last impulsive move would be explosive and could lead to life-changing gains for the bulls. However, for now, he believes that XRP is simply ranging until it closes above $3.20. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

Bitcoin has climbed above $123,000 driven by increased institutional interest, macro uncertainty tied to a U.S. government shutdown, and momentum from ETF inflows. Market participants cite both fundamental demand and short-term liquidity dynamics as contributors to the rapid advance. How credible is JPMorgan’s $165,000 projection? JPMorgan analysts argue Bitcoin remains undervalued relative to gold and could reach near $165,000 by late 2025 driven by institutional allocation. This view rests on models comparing digital scarcity to gold and assumes steady inflows from large financial players. Why do some analysts call the move a “liquidity wave”? Alex Blume of Two Prime described the rally as a “liquidity wave,” suggesting short-term capital and trading flows may amplify prices without sustained retail or institutional demand. In this scenario, price action can retrace quickly if liquidity conditions shift. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to interpret Bitcoin's Uptober rally\", \"description\": \"Steps for investors to evaluate whether the Uptober rally is sustainable or a temporary liquidity-driven move.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Check institutional signals\", \"text\": \"Review reports and filings referencing institutional allocations and ETF flows for sustained demand indicators.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Monitor macro drivers\", \"text\": \"Assess macro events such as government shutdowns, currency weakness, and rate expectations that can increase crypto demand.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Evaluate on-chain metrics\", \"text\": \"Analyze on-chain data—exchange flows, large-wallet accumulation, and active addresses—to differentiate liquidity spikes from genuine accumulation.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Set risk management parameters\", \"text\": \"Define stop-loss levels and position sizing in case the rally proves transient; prepare for volatility when liquidity fades.\" } ]} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Is Bitcoin’s rise above $123,000 a new bull market?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Not necessarily; the price rise may signal the start of a sustained bull run if institutional inflows continue, but it can also be a short-lived liquidity-driven spike.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"What risks could stop Bitcoin’s momentum?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Key risks include a reversal in liquidity conditions, unfavorable regulatory actions, rapid interest-rate moves, or a sharp drop in ETF inflows.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How are altcoins responding to Bitcoin’s move?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Ethereum and many large-cap altcoins have rallied alongside Bitcoin; Ethereum rose roughly 9% to around $4,500 as of the latest trading session.\" } } ]} When might the rally become a sustainable bull run? For a sustainable bull market, Bitcoin prices must be supported by persistent demand across multiple channels: continued institutional allocations, steady retail participation, and improving on-chain adoption metrics. Confirmation typically requires price holding key support levels and consistent net inflows over several weeks. What does Ethereum’s move tell us about market breadth? Ethereum’s ~9% weekly gain to $4,500 indicates broader market participation beyond Bitcoin. Strong moves in large-cap altcoins often suggest increased risk appetite and can support the narrative that the rally has participation across crypto sectors. Frequently Asked Questions How high could Bitcoin go this year according to major banks? JPMorgan has a target scenario near $165,000 by year-end, based on relative value versus gold and expected institutional flows. These are analytical projections, not guaranteed outcomes. What should traders watch during Uptober? Monitor liquidity measures, ETF flows, macro headlines (e.g., government actions, rate expectations), and on-chain indicators to gauge whether gains are demand-driven or liquidity-driven. Key Takeaways Bitcoin moved above $123,000 : This level is the immediate pivot for bulls and bears. Institutional outlook is supportive : JPMorgan projects potential upside, reinforcing institutional narratives. Risks remain : Analysts warn some gains may be liquidity-driven; risk management is essential. Conclusion Bitcoin’s Uptober rally—pushing prices above $123,000—reflects a complex mix of institutional interest, macro uncertainty, and short-term liquidity dynamics. While projections such as JPMorgan’s $165,000 target add bullish context, caution from market experts reminds investors to weigh on-chain data and liquidity signals.

        "url": "https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-outlook-analysts-weigh-sol-xrp-and-little-pepe-heres-which-one-will-dominate-in-2025/",
        "body": "SOL is holding firm at $200 as it battles to stay afloat. Several factors suggest it could rebound soon. Besides Solana, two other projects are contending for dominance: Ripple (XRP) and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Each one of them is gaining significant attention in the crypto space. Their setup suggests that they could dominate in 2025. In this article, we will discuss each and find out which one will win in 2025. Solana (SOL): Institutional Magnet With Expanding On-Chain Utility Solana (SOL) trades near $203, after a pullback from earlier-month highs. However, on-chain activity remains robust. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) stands at around $13–14 billion, with healthy DEX and perpetual (perp) volumes supporting the network’s utility. Institutional flows have continued through the correction. The REX-Osprey Solana ETF experienced notable inflows of $65 million in mid-September, despite prices softening. Also, staking-oriented ETF products are expanding institutional access. Recent SEC rule changes have also lowered the bar for spot crypto ETFs, potentially accelerating product launches tied to SOL. Together, these factors suggest SOL could benefit if institutional allocation and on-chain demand persist. Ripple (XRP): Regulatory Clarity Meets Amidst Institutional Demand XRP trades near $2.80 as ETF optimism rises. It has recently partnered with DBS and Franklin Templeton to enable tokenized money-market fund trading on the XRP Ledger. This highlights institutional use cases beyond pure payments. The SEC’s September rule updates have also made multiple spot-ETF filings more feasible. This increases the odds of XRP-linked products and potential large inflows. Still, analysts caution that ETF approvals alone may not translate into sustained retail rallies unless institutional adoption leads to on-ledger volume and real-world flows. For instance, despite strong volume from the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF, XRP’s price has only fallen further below. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Culture Reinvented With Real Utility Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has positioned itself as a new frontier in meme tokens. It combines community-driven appeal with a solid technical foundation. Its presale, now in Stage 13, has already raised over $26.3 million and sold more than 16 billion tokens at $0.0022. This signals a strong early conviction among investors. Little Pepe is powered by Pepe Chain, an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 built for memes. The chain delivers low gas fees and fast finality. It also offers built-in protections against sniper bots. Its tokenomics are designed to reward sustainability. It includes zero buy/sell tax, staking mechanisms, and a share allocated for ecosystem growth. A key pillar is Pepe’s Pump Pad, the native launchpad that allows meme projects to deploy directly on the chain. Tokens launched via the pump pad help drive transaction volume, feeding demand back into LILPEPE itself. This creates a looping effect of utility and engagement. Credibility has been bolstered through a successful CertiK audit and listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. On the team side, Little Pepe is backed by anonymous experts with experience in meme project growth. This gives it a level of credibility that’s easily backed by its roadmap. Planned listings on two Tier-1 centralized exchanges at launch, along with future plans for the world’s largest exchange, could put LILPEPE in the spotlight as trading begins. Given its lower valuation, strong ecosystem design, and viral potential, Little Pepe may offer higher upside growth curves. SOL vs. XRP vs. LILPEPE: Which One Will Dominate in 2025? Solana offers institutional-grade security and broad infrastructure utilization. This makes it a reliable foundation for numerous blockchain applications. If demand for scalable smart contract platforms continues under regulatory clarity, SOL may capture substantial adoption. XRP’s strength lies in serving as a regulatory and institutional bridge—if legal frameworks favor financial token use cases, XRP could benefit strongly. Yet, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the wildcard. While SOL and XRP dominate with utility and legitimacy, LILPEPE blends memetic culture and core infrastructure, targeting the meme sector itself. In a cycle that may lean heavily on viral growth and novelty, LILPEPE could outperform in percentage gains. Analysts may see SOL capturing market share and XRP anchoring institutional flows. However, for raw upside, Little Pepe stands as the candidate with the most room to scale. Dominance depends on whether 2025 rewards infrastructure, regulation, or memetic innovation. And LILPEPE is best positioned if meme-utility fusion becomes the narrative. Conclusion Solana, Ripple, and Little Pepe each present a distinct path toward dominance in 2025. SOL combines infrastructure strength and adoption. On the other hand, XRP bridges financial legitimacy with crypto access. But it is Little Pepe that merges meme culture with technical depth, offering potentially explosive growth. Though it carries a higher risk, its robust presale performance, ecosystem development, and launchpad mechanics provide it with the framework to compete meaningfully. For investors seeking asymmetric upside in the meme sector, Little Pepe deserves serious consideration. Visit the Little Pepe website or join its Telegram to stay ahead of listings and developments.

        "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-meets-retail-walmart-linked-fintech-expands-into-digital-assets/",
        "body": "OnePay, the fintech linked to Walmart, plans to add crypto trading to its mobile banking app later in 2025, according to multiple reports. Sources told news outlets that users will be able to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) inside the app, a move that would expand OnePay’s lineup of financial services beyond savings and cards. OnePay To Add Crypto Trading Reports have disclosed that the crypto functions will be powered through a tie-up with Zerohash, a firm that provides custody and settlement services for digital assets. That suggests OnePay will rely on outside infrastructure rather than build all systems itself. OnePay was launched in 2021 and is majority owned by Walmart, with early backing from Ribbit Capital, and the company has been steadily rolling out banking features since then. Partnerships And Product Plans OnePay is working with Synchrony to relaunch Walmart’s credit card offerings, and Reuters reported a Synchrony announcement dated June 9, 2025, about card programs set to return this fall. The app also aims to offer savings accounts and buy-now, pay-later options alongside the new crypto window. Users may be given the ability to convert crypto to fiat and then use those funds for purchases in Walmart stores or to pay card balances, though the exact mechanics have not been fully detailed by company spokespeople. How Much Will Users Get Access To At First? Several outlets suggest OnePay will start with the two largest tokens, BTC and ETH, rather than a long list of coins. Limits, fees and state availability were not disclosed in the reports, and those details could change before any public launch. Sources said the rollout is expected sometime later in 2025, with the credit card program arriving in fall 2025, but no firm launch date for crypto trading has been announced. Regulatory Hurdles And Timing Regulators at the state and federal level are actively watching crypto offerings from consumer apps, and compliance requirements could shape how quickly OnePay moves. Based On reports, the company has not publicly filed detailed disclosures tied to the crypto service, and both Walmart and OnePay declined to comment to reporters. That leaves open the possibility of a phased release, restricted to certain users or states at first. What This Means For Shoppers And Users If the plan proceeds, Walmart customers who already use OnePay could gain another way to access BTC and ETH without signing up for a separate crypto exchange. Analysts and users will be watching fees, protections for deposits, and whether the app allows spending crypto directly in stores or requires conversion first.

        "body": "As Solana (SOL) matures, the rapid short-term gains it once offered are becoming harder to replicate. The early-day investors who saw $200 turn into $5,000 have largely exited that window. Newer entrants in 2025 are looking at high-utility early-stage projects and still provide explosive upside. A crypto that already provides such an opportunity is Little Pepe (LILPEPE)—a meme coin that has a real-life blockchain application. Having sold a record presale and increasing token price, Little Pepe is coming out as a top choice. Little Pepe: Ethereum Layer 2, Zero Tax, Staking, and DAO Governance Little Pepe is an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 blockchain with a combination of meme culture and real utility. The project features staking rewards, voting in the DAO, and launching memes, and zero taxation is applied to the trading. Future integrations are NFTs and cross-chain compatibility, expanding its possible application. The LILPEPE ecosystem will be designed to ensure that there is a balance between liquidity, reserves, staking, marketing and CEX preparedness with a total supply of 100 billion tokens. $26.3M raised so far: a clear presale trajectory Since launching its presale on June 10, Little Pepe has advanced through 13 stages, steadily increasing in value. Stage 1 began at $0.001, with subsequent stages climbing by $0.0001 per phase. By Stage 13, now active, the token price has reached $0.0022. To date, $26,382,101 has been raised out of a $28,775,000 target. A total of 16,162,317,775 tokens have already been sold from the 17,250,000,000 allocation. Stage 14 will introduce yet another uptick at $0.0023, which will be a 130% increase compared to the price of Stage 1. This continued flow has placed early investors near breakeven or gaining even before the presale ends, thus showing strong momentum and interest. $777,000 giveaway now live for presale contributors A $777,000 giveaway is currently live to celebrate the presale. Ten winners will receive $77,000 each in $LILPEPE tokens. To enter, participants must contribute at least $100 to the ongoing presale. The promotion is active during presale stages only and also includes random big buyer rewards (15+ ETH) between Stages 12 and 17. Little Pepe presents a new investment window that mirrors the early Solana days. The project shows actual blockchain value with a fast-moving presale, the Layer 2 architecture, zero tax on trading, staking, governance of the project through DAOs, and future NFTs. According to the present momentum and tokenomics, LILPEPE has all the potential to become one of the most successful crypto assets in 2025.

        "body": "If you have $1,500 set aside for a high-potential crypto play, there is a fresh name that is catching the eye of early investors. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) built on Ethereum is not just another meme coin. It has already climbed more than 120% from its starting presale price and is currently offering about 36.36% projected gains before its public launch. At the time of writing, LILPEPE is priced at $0.0022 in Stage 13 of its presale, having raised an impressive $26.37 million out of a $28.77 million target. A meme coin with momentum Little Pepe is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about Ethereum meme coins of 2025. The token’s presale has been moving at an incredible pace, with more than 16.15 billion of its 17.25 billion tokens already sold. The presale price recently increased from $0.0021 to $0.0022, reflecting steady demand. This is no small feat considering that Stage 1 investors are already sitting on 120% gains while the presale still has six stages left. The project’s momentum is further boosted by its recent listing on CoinMarketCap and a Certik audit score of 95.49%, which strengthens investor confidence. Being both audited and trackable on a significant platform gives LILPEPE credibility that most meme coins lack. Why investors are watching LILPEPE closely The appeal of Little Pepe goes beyond just hype. It is positioning itself as a Layer 2 meme ecosystem that offers zero trading tax, anti-sniper bot protection, and plans for a meme launchpad and NFT marketplace. These features suggest that it aims to be more than a fleeting trend. Community engagement has been high, with the Team running a $777,000 giveaway and introducing a Mega Giveaway worth over 15 ETH in prizes for top presale buyers from Stage 12 to Stage 17. At a time when crypto markets are searching for the next breakout star after Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, LILPEPE’s strong presale and active rewards are pulling in attention from across the meme coin crowd. How LILPEPE stacks up against the big names As of the time of writing, DOGE trades around $0.12 while SHIB hovers near $0.000018. These meme coins still have strong communities but lack the fresh momentum that drives rapid price surges. Little Pepe has stepped into that gap with a lower entry price and a roadmap that blends meme culture with practical tools. The fact that LILPEPE peaked above PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB in ChatGPT’s memecoin search trends between June and August 2025 hints at rising retail interest. The potential upside For investors entering at Stage 13’s $0.0022 price, the token is expected to launch at $0.0030, offering a near-term 36.36% gain even before its first day of open trading. Early-stage buyers have already seen 120% gains, and the speculative talk of a 75x rally reflects hopes that it can catch a fraction of the market cap of DOGE or SHIB as it gains mainstream attention. Final thoughts If you are looking for a fresh entry into the meme coin market and have $1,500 to spare, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is worth a closer look. It combines meme culture with credible tech and is already rewarding early participants. With the presale selling out fast at the time of writing and still offering projected gains of 36.36% before launch, this could be a rare chance to enter early. The presale is nearing its final stages, and as history has shown with other meme sensations, the early days often present the biggest growth window.

        "body": "The 2025 market is shaping up to be one of the most competitive in crypto history. Big names like Dogecoin and Solana are still drawing capital, but a newcomer, Little Pepe, is quietly stacking numbers that hint at far greater upside. Here’s how each project positions itself and why one could realistically deliver 45x gains. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Energy With Real Tech Underneath Little Pepe (LILPEPE) isn’t just another token riding Ethereum’s coattails. It’s building its own Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 network that handles transactions cheaply and at scale. Think of it as a meme coin with the backbone of a serious blockchain. The presale tells the story. With a hard cap of 100 billion tokens, 26.5 billion are set aside for early buyers. Stage 13 is live at $0.0022; more than 16.15 billion tokens have already been sold, pulling in $26.36 million. Stage 14 will tick up to $0.0023, a 120% jump from the starting price of $0.001. Early participants have already locked in triple-digit paper gains before a single exchange listing. Every presale round has increased the price. Stage 1 raised $500K at $0.001, Stage 2 climbed to $0.0011 for $1.325 million, Stage 3 reached $0.0012 for $2.5 million, creating a built-in momentum machine that rewards early conviction. Why Investors Are Taking Notice Little Pepe isn’t just relying on hype. Its feature set is designed to solve real issues in the meme coin space. There’s zero trading tax, so holders keep every bit of their gains. Sniper-bot protection ensures a fairer launch and less manipulation, and staking functionality enables long-term investors to earn passive income. Yet the most interesting element is the Meme Launchpad, an incubator that natively enables emerging meme projects to launch within the Little Pepe ecosystem. With DAO-based governance, NFT integration, and cross-chain compatibility on the roadmap in the future, the project is building foundations that could extend far beyond its current Layer 2 focus. To keep the community buzzing, the team has stacked giveaways. The headline is a $777,000 presale prize pool , with ten winners taking home $77,000 each, and a minimum buy-in of just $100. A separate Mega Giveaway across Stages 12–17 adds over 15 ETH in rewards, split between top buyers and random participants. Few meme projects have aggressively combined hype, utility, and incentive structures. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Original Meme Giant Faces New Challenges Dogecoin still holds cultural sway, but its momentum has certainly slowed. DOGE has not returned to the heights of around $0.74, and subsequent corrections in 2025 have tempered investors’ expectations. All that could change with the recently launched Rex-Osprey Dogecoin ETF, which could introduce institutional money into the picture and potentially drive DOGE to $0.40 or even $1. Still, the days of 100x returns are likely behind it. As the meme coin landscape shifts toward projects with stronger utility and more robust ecosystems, Dogecoin’s once-unassailable throne looks more vulnerable than ever. Solana (SOL): The Backbone of DeFi’s Next Wave Solana remains one of the most essential blockchains in the Web3 space and for good reason. It can process thousands of transactions per second at minimal cost and become the go-to network for lending platforms, NFT marketplaces, and DeFi protocols. If adoption keeps climbing at the current pace, analysts predict a price range of $500–$750 by 2030, particularly as institutional capital continues to pour in. Solana’s Firedancer will continue to enhance stability, solidifying Solana as a foundational layer for the next generation of dApps. Bottom Line Dogecoin and Solana offer proven ecosystems and the comfort of established networks, but their upside is capped. Little Pepe , still priced at just $0.0022, sits where past giants once stood, early, hungry, and built to scale. If its Layer-2 tech, launchpad, and aggressive presale strategy keep gaining traction, a 45x move isn’t a fantasy. The window to grab LILPEPE under a quarter of a cent is barely open for investors chasing the next breakout before the market wakes up.

        "body": "Brazil’s largest investment bank, BTG Pactual’s crypto platform Mynt, has flagged five cryptocurrencies it believes are well-positioned for gains in October: bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), solana (SOL), avalanche (AVAX), and sky (SKY). The picks, outlined in a report authored by Matheus Parizotto and João Galhardo, reflect a broader optimism in the crypto market as U.S. interest rates ease and anticipation builds for new crypto ETFs. Bitcoin remains the dominant institutional pick, with more than $3.5 billion flowing into spot ETFs in September and corporate treasuries adding 43,000 BTC, over $5 billion at current prices. Mynt’s report describes it as a long-term anchor. “For those seeking a long-term pillar in their portfolio, BTC offers liquidity, network security, and a track record of adoption that extends beyond retail investors,” it reads. Ether, it says, continues to lead in on-chain finance. BTG Pactual’s team pointed out the network concentrates the majority of stablecoin volume and real-world asset tokenization projects. Over the last six months, U.S. spot ETFs added $11.3 billion in ETH, while corporate treasuries picked up 816,000 ETH in September alone. To the analysts, these flows show institutional appetite remains elevated. Beyond the top two Solana’s case hinges on speed and cost. The network, BTG Pactual pointed out, processed over $100 billion in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume for the third straight month, while its total value locked surpassed $30 billion for the first time in a sign of deepening DeFi liquidity. The analysts added that institutional demand has been increasing with the potential arrival of new spot SOL ETFs, which could lead to greater flows and visibility. “For those seeking exposure to high-performance infrastructure with growing adoption in real-world cases, Solana combines scale, competitive cost, and an accelerating network effect,” the report reads. For AVAX, BTG Pactual highlighted its sharp growth in on-chain activity, noting that daily transactions increased by 46% and stablecoin transfers rose by 421% over the last quarter. The network’s subnet architecture allows enterprises to spin up custom blockchains, boosting real-world use cases, it said. Sky Protocol, the rebranded MakerDAO, rounds out the list. Its stablecoin, USDS, has a circulating supply of nearly $8 billion, and its Sky Savings Rate offers a variable return that’s currently at 4.75%. Coupled with a token buyback program that’s already deployed $77 million, the report is positioning SKY as a revenue-generating DeFi token with long-term potential.",

        "body": "In the world of digital assets, momentum can shift in an instant. A single technical signal—especially on a higher-timeframe chart—can mark the difference between quiet consolidation and explosive upside. For XRP, that moment may be near. Analysts are closely monitoring the charts, where a rare combination of bullish signals is emerging, suggesting a potential price breakout could be imminent. Cryptoinsightuk Flags Bullish RSI Signal Market analyst Cryptoinsightuk has sounded the alarm for XRP holders, noting that the asset’s three-day chart is now showing a bullish Relative Strength Index (RSI) crossover alongside a strong three-day candle close. The analyst emphasized that this particular alignment has preceded major upward moves for XRP in the past—pointing to the last three instances on November 5, 2024, April 19, 2025, and June 27, 2025. We are in the territory where we could see a pop to the upside for $XRP at any point imo. We got a great 3 Day candle close yesterday and bullish cross on the 3 day RSI. Here are the last 3 times we saw this happen pic.twitter.com/NzPHCMjvqS — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) October 4, 2025 Each of those historical signals coincided with significant bullish momentum, suggesting the current setup could mark the beginning of another leg higher. “We are in the territory where we could see a pop to the upside for XRP at any point,” Cryptoinsightuk wrote, reinforcing that the chart structure remains technically constructive. Understanding the Technical Setup A bullish RSI crossover occurs when short-term momentum breaks above its longer-term trend line—an early indication that buying pressure is starting to dominate. When this signal appears on the three-day timeframe, it’s more significant than similar signals on shorter intervals because it indicates sustained market strength rather than short-term volatility. Coupled with the recent strong candle close, this crossover suggests that bulls are regaining control after a period of consolidation. Historically, such alignments on XRP’s chart have led to strong continuation rallies, provided they are confirmed by volume and price action in subsequent sessions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Resistance Levels and Market Context From a technical perspective, XRP faces its next resistance band between $3.20 and $3.65, a region that has repeatedly capped price advances in 2025. A decisive breakout and sustained close above that zone could unlock further upside momentum , potentially validating the “pop” scenario that traders like Cryptoinsightuk anticipate. Broader market conditions also favor bullish sentiment. Bitcoin remains strong above six-figure levels, overall liquidity has improved across digital assets, and institutional participation in on-chain settlement projects continues to grow. These factors collectively create an environment in which XRP could benefit from renewed investor confidence. Risk and Confirmation While optimism is building, analysts caution that no technical indicator guarantees results. RSI crossovers can produce false signals if volume fails to confirm or if sudden macro news shifts sentiment. Traders are advised to manage risk carefully, watch for volume-supported breakouts, and avoid over-leveraging positions during volatility spikes. The Bottom Line With momentum indicators in sync and historical patterns resurfacing, XRP seems poised for a potential breakout. As Cryptoinsightuk highlights, the market is once again positioned where a strong upward move could emerge at any time. Whether that surge materializes will depend on confirmation in the coming days—but for now, XRP sits squarely in what analysts call breakout territory .

        "title": "XRP On-Chain Activity Signals Imminent Sell-Off — What’s Happening?",
        "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp/",
        "body": "An alarming pattern of XRP whale activity has been noted, posing several questions about the sustainability of the cryptocurrency’s growth. Among the multiple questions currently being asked, one is more demanding of an immediate response: Is an XRP whale sell-off on its way? XRP Supply Surges Across Major Exchanges In an October 3rd post on the social media platform X, market analyst CryptoOnchain highlighted a recent shift in the behavior of XRP’s largest holders, the whales. The online pundit’s report was based on the Exchange Supply Ratio indicator, which tracks the proportion of XRP tokens on exchanges relative to its total circulating supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Exchange Inflows Hit $5.7B: Profit-Taking Already Underway? This metric can be used to derive insights on potential selling pressure for a crypto asset (XRP, in this case), seeing as higher values would suggest increased availability of tokens on the exchange for sale. According to CryptoOnchain, there has been a spike in XRP supply across major exchanges, suggesting that whales might be positioning for a significant sell-off. The data shared reflects the increase in selling pressure across these exchanges, including Bithumb, Bitget, Bitfinex, and Binance, putting the XRP price at an increased risk of a sharp correction. XRP Displays Bearish Divergence As Sellers Dominate Futures Market In a separate post made on the CryptoQuant platform, CryptoOnchain also revealed a budding negative divergence across the XRP futures market. The relevant indicator here is the Taker Buy Sell Ratio metric, which monitors the balance between aggressive buy and sell orders in the futures market. This metric is typically used to assess whether buyers or sellers are dominating the market in the short term. The analyst noted that while the price of XRP has been mostly around $3 after its recent rise, the ‘Taker Ratio’ across exchanges has fallen to its lowest level since November 2024. Interestingly, data from Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, further supports this bearish signal, as patterns similar to those seen on other exchanges have also been surfacing. Related Reading: Ethereum Matches Bitcoin In Annual Gains: What This Means For The Market CryptoOnchain explained that this situation could either mean that the market participants are booking profits or anticipating a price decline in the near future. However, the spike in XRP supply across major crypto exchanges, alongside the clear dominance of sellers in the perpetual futures market, strongly suggests the imminence of a price correction. It is therefore advisable to watch the psychological $3 level closely before market decisions are made. As of this writing, XRP is hovering around the $3 mark, reflecting a nearly 2% decline in the past 24 hours. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView",

        "body": "SOL is holding firm at $200 as it battles to stay afloat. Several factors suggest it could rebound soon. Besides Solana, two other projects are contending for dominance: Ripple (XRP) and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Each one of them is gaining significant attention in the crypto space. Their setup suggests that they could dominate in 2025. In this article, we will discuss each and find out which one will win in 2025. Solana (SOL): Institutional Magnet With Expanding On-Chain Utility Solana (SOL) trades near $203, after a pullback from earlier-month highs. However, on-chain activity remains robust. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) stands at around $13–14 billion, with healthy DEX and perpetual (perp) volumes supporting the network’s utility. Institutional flows have continued through the correction. The REX-Osprey Solana ETF experienced notable inflows of $65 million in mid-September, despite prices softening. Also, staking-oriented ETF products are expanding institutional access. Recent SEC rule changes have also lowered the bar for spot crypto ETFs, potentially accelerating product launches tied to SOL. Together, these factors suggest SOL could benefit if institutional allocation and on-chain demand persist. Ripple (XRP): Regulatory Clarity Meets Amidst Institutional Demand XRP trades near $2.80 as ETF optimism rises. It has recently partnered with DBS and Franklin Templeton to enable tokenized money-market fund trading on the XRP Ledger. This highlights institutional use cases beyond pure payments. The SEC’s September rule updates have also made multiple spot-ETF filings more feasible. This increases the odds of XRP-linked products and potential large inflows. Still, analysts caution that ETF approvals alone may not translate into sustained retail rallies unless institutional adoption leads to on-ledger volume and real-world flows. For instance, despite strong volume from the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF, XRP’s price has only fallen further below. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Culture Reinvented With Real Utility Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has positioned itself as a new frontier in meme tokens. It combines community-driven appeal with a solid technical foundation. Its presale, now in Stage 13, has already raised over $26.3 million and sold more than 16 billion tokens at $0.0022. This signals a strong early conviction among investors. Little Pepe is powered by Pepe Chain, an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 built for memes. The chain delivers low gas fees and fast finality. It also offers built-in protections against sniper bots. Its tokenomics are designed to reward sustainability. It includes zero buy/sell tax, staking mechanisms, and a share allocated for ecosystem growth. A key pillar is Pepe’s Pump Pad, the native launchpad that allows meme projects to deploy directly on the chain. Tokens launched via the pump pad help drive transaction volume, feeding demand back into LILPEPE itself. This creates a looping effect of utility and engagement. Credibility has been bolstered through a successful CertiK audit and listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. On the team side, Little Pepe is backed by anonymous experts with experience in meme project growth. This gives it a level of credibility that’s easily backed by its roadmap. Planned listings on two Tier-1 centralized exchanges at launch, along with future plans for the world’s largest exchange, could put LILPEPE in the spotlight as trading begins. Given its lower valuation, strong ecosystem design, and viral potential, Little Pepe may offer higher upside growth curves. SOL vs. XRP vs. LILPEPE: Which One Will Dominate in 2025? Solana offers institutional-grade security and broad infrastructure utilization. This makes it a reliable foundation for numerous blockchain applications. If demand for scalable smart contract platforms continues under regulatory clarity, SOL may capture substantial adoption. XRP’s strength lies in serving as a regulatory and institutional bridge—if legal frameworks favor financial token use cases, XRP could benefit strongly. Yet, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the wildcard. While SOL and XRP dominate with utility and legitimacy, LILPEPE blends memetic culture and core infrastructure, targeting the meme sector itself. In a cycle that may lean heavily on viral growth and novelty, LILPEPE could outperform in percentage gains. Analysts may see SOL capturing market share and XRP anchoring institutional flows. However, for raw upside, Little Pepe stands as the candidate with the most room to scale. Dominance depends on whether 2025 rewards infrastructure, regulation, or memetic innovation. And LILPEPE is best positioned if meme-utility fusion becomes the narrative. Conclusion Solana, Ripple, and Little Pepe each present a distinct path toward dominance in 2025. SOL combines infrastructure strength and adoption. On the other hand, XRP bridges financial legitimacy with crypto access. But it is Little Pepe that merges meme culture with technical depth, offering potentially explosive growth. Though it carries a higher risk, its robust presale performance, ecosystem development, and launchpad mechanics provide it with the framework to compete meaningfully. For investors seeking asymmetric upside in the meme sector, Little Pepe deserves serious consideration. Visit the Little Pepe website or join its Telegram to stay ahead of listings and developments.

        "url": "https://timestabloid.com/eric-trump-i-know-brad-garlinghouse-and-xrp-very-well/",
        "body": "A single podcast moment has sent ripples through both the political and crypto worlds. During a recent appearance on the PBD Podcast, Eric Trump made striking comments about his familiarity with Ripple, XRP, and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. The clip, shared by popular crypto influencer JackTheRippler on X, quickly gained momentum — fueling widespread discussion about the growing intersection between politics and digital finance. The conversation took place during the October 4, 2025, episode of the PBD Podcast, hosted by entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David. When asked how he felt about Dogecoin, XRP, Ripple, and Ethereum, Eric Trump’s candid response caught the attention of the crypto community. “I know them all extremely well. I know Brad very well, and XRP, he’s done a great job,” Trump said. JackTheRippler’s post featuring the clip has since gone viral, with thousands of reposts and comments from the XRP community. Many enthusiasts see Trump’s acknowledgment of Garlinghouse as a symbolic nod to Ripple’s growing relevance in global finance — especially as the company continues to recover from years of legal scrutiny and reposition itself for mainstream adoption. Eric Trump says that he knows Brad Garlinghouse and #XRP very well! pic.twitter.com/EK4bygBRLh — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 4, 2025 A Notable Moment for Ripple and XRP Ripple’s reputation has strengthened considerably in 2025 following the conclusion of its legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple has focused on scaling its payment infrastructure and expanding the reach of RLUSD. In this context, Eric Trump’s praise for Brad Garlinghouse carries additional weight. His words come at a time when institutional interest in blockchain payment systems is accelerating — and when the U.S. political landscape is increasingly open to discussing crypto innovation within regulated frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bridging Politics and Crypto Innovation Eric Trump’s remarks also highlight a broader trend: the mainstreaming of cryptocurrency within political and economic circles. His characterization of Bitcoin as “digital gold” and Ethereum as “financial oil” reflects an informed understanding of their roles within the digital economy. Yet, it was his personal acknowledgment of Brad Garlinghouse and XRP that truly resonated with investors, given Ripple’s established presence in institutional payment settlements. The moment signifies how figures within political leadership are beginning to publicly recognize the companies driving blockchain utility, not just speculative assets. In conclusion, while Eric Trump did not make any investment claims about XRP, his recognition of Brad Garlinghouse and Ripple stands as a noteworthy endorsement from a prominent political figure. The viral clip shared by JackTheRippler underscores how quickly influence, politics, and crypto narratives can converge — sometimes in just a few seconds of conversation. For Ripple and its supporters, those few words from the president’s son may have done more than spark social-media buzz; they reaffirmed that XRP’s name is now part of the mainstream financial dialogue.

        "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-7-year-double-bottom/",
        "body": "Crypto analyst Bobby revealed that the XRP price has completed a consolidation pattern, hinting at a potential parabolic rally for the altcoin soon. The analyst suggested that XRP’s price could rally to double digits once this rally occurs. XRP Price Eyes Rally To $19 As It Completes Double-Bottom Pattern In an X post, Bobby indicated that the XRP price has completed the macro double-bottom pattern, which it had spent over seven years building. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the altcoin is now gearing up for a rally to as high as $19 following the completion of this consolidation pattern. Related Reading: XRP Price Faces 25% Drawdown Risk, But This Technical Point Is Key Meanwhile, the analyst noted that the XRP price spent over nine months building support near the neckline of the massive W pattern. He added that the altcoin spent the same amount of time consolidating below the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of its latest macro swing high to swing low. Bobby indicated that the XRP price rally will begin once it breaks through $3.02 and gains monthly acceptance above that level. He expects this move to take XRP into the take-profit levels he has highlighted on several occasions. These levels include $4.7, $6.4, $7.4, and possibly $19, all of which mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for the altcoin. The analyst also predicts that the XRP ETFs could spark a rally to between $8 and $13 with possible wicks into the $20 range. These funds are expected to launch this month, depending on when the U.S. government shutdown ends. They provided a bullish outlook for XRP due to the amount of inflows that they could drive into the altcoin’s ecosystem. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that Bobby had also earlier alluded to previous cycles as the reason XRP could rally to $13. Analyst Sounds Warning To Bulls Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has warned XRP bulls that the XRP price needs to close above $3.13 to $3.20 on the 3-day chart to sustain the current bullish momentum. His warning followed XRP’s reclaim of the psychological $3 level, which he noted has wrecked the bears. However, the altcoin needs to close above this range, or the bulls are also in danger of getting wrecked. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Remains Bullish As This Level Holds Egrag Crypto stated that the XRP price could follow suit if Bitcoin and Ethereum get rejected on their current rallies. He added that the altcoin could head lower, which he believes might actually be better. He assured that the last impulsive move would be explosive and could lead to life-changing gains for the bulls. However, for now, he believes that XRP is simply ranging until it closes above $3.20. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

        "body": "Key Takeaways : The Celestia price prediction for 2025 suggests a maximum price of $21.22. By 2028, TIA could attain a maximum price of $64.46 and an average price of $56.11. In 2031, the TIA price forecast expects a maximum price of $156.88. Celestia generated significant interest before its October 2023 launch. This was largely due to the strong backing from major crypto exchanges from the outset and the intriguing technical concepts behind the Celestia modular blockchain network. In this article, we’ll provide a Celestia price prediction, analyze the factors driving these projections, and explore what the Celestia modular blockchain network brings to the broader crypto landscape. Overview Cryptocurrency Celestia Token TIA Price $1.47 (-1.8%) Market cap $1.68 Billion Trading volume (24-hour) $87.3 Million Circulating supply 639.85 Million TIA All-time high $20.91; Feb 10, 2024 All-time low $2.03; Oct 31, 2023 24-hour high $1.6 24-hour low $1.38 TIA price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $ 1.47 Price Prediction $ 1.10 (-25.15%) Fear & Greed Index 71 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 9.65% Green Days 16/30 (53%) 50-Day SMA $ 1.66 200-Day SMA $ 2.28 14-Day RSI 44.76 TIA price analysis: TIA price faces a selling pressure toward $1.45 TIA price analysis shows volatility toward $1.45 Resistance for TIA is present at $1.587 Support for TIA/USD is present at $1.325 The TIA price analysis for October 4 confirms that TIA is witnessing bearish volatility toward the $1.45 level.

TIA price analysis 1-day chart: TIA price faces minor selling pressure Analyzing the daily Celestia price chart, TIA price is facing rising bearish momentum as sellers pushed the price toward $1.45. The recent highs triggered selling pressure, resulting in a decline below immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume declined to $12.6 million, showing a slight decrease in trading activity today. TIA is trading at $1.46, declining by over 1.8% in the last 24 hours. TIA/USD chart.

The SMA-14 level suggests lower volatility for the next few hours. TIA/USD 4-hour price chart: Bears aim for a hold below moving averages The 4-hour TIA price chart suggests TIA continues to experience intense volatility between $1 and $1.5, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. Currently, bears aim for a strong domination as the price prepares for a hold below EMA lines. TIA/USD chart. Image source: TradingView The BoP indicator is bullish at 0, suggesting that buyers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost upward correction. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening bearish positions.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent TIA prices from an immediate surge. However, if the TIA price successfully breaks above $1.587, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $1.938. TIA/USD chart. Image source: TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, the TIA price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.325, resulting in a correction to $1.106. Is TIA a good investment? Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price is attempting to hold below $1.5 as buyers lost confidence, resulting in a decline below Fib channels. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. It is advised to do own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile crypto market. Recent news/opinions on TIA Celestia has announced that its v6 upgrade, Matcha, went live on Arabica testnet. Celestia’s v6 upgrade, Matcha 🍵, is now live on Arabica testnet. Matcha, the biggest upgrade yet, enables scaling to 128MB blocks and cuts inflation by 50%. pic.twitter.com/hxj68IZKAB — Celestia 🦣 (@celestia) September 9, 2025 Celestia price prediction October 2025 Celestia’s price is surging following Bitcoin’s surge toward $120K. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $1.2 and a maximum of $2.3, with an average of $1.8. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction October 2025 $1.2 $1.8 $2.3 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $1, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

        "url": "https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-is-btc-about-to-explode-to-130k-this-week-2/",
        "body": "Bitcoin has extended its rally after a clean breakout from the descending channel, reclaiming primary structural levels and driving toward the $122K–$124K all-time high. While momentum remains strongly bullish, the market is still exposed to a brief pullback toward $114K–$118K to rebalance before any potential continuation toward new highs. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin has continued its upward expansion, breaking through the mid-range resistance and invalidating the prior descending structure that defined September’s price action. The breakout was followed by a rapid move into the upper boundary of the macro range, likely targeting the buy-side liquidity just above the all-time high around $124K. The price is now holding above the breakout level around $116K–$118K, with the previous decision point at $112K–$114K serving as key support in case of a retracement. Holding above this zone maintains the bullish structure, keeping the $124K–$125K region, where the next liquidity pool sits, as the primary upside target. Momentum indicators, however, suggest the potential for a short-term corrective move before continuation, allowing the market to build a healthier base for another impulsive leg higher. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart The recent surge from the $108K demand zone triggered an impulsive rally that left behind several unmitigated areas of interest. The breaker block at $115K–$117K and the Fibonacci retracement cluster between $114.4K and $113.1K now mark the nearest re-entry zones for buyers. A controlled pullback toward these levels would likely attract renewed demand for continuation toward $124K, where the next major buy-side liquidity cluster lies. If price maintains its current momentum, a sweep above $124K could occur before a corrective phase, aligning with the broader bullish expansion structure as long as the market holds above $111K–$112K. Source: TradingView Sentiment Analysis By Shayan Bitcoin’s open interest on Binance has reached a new record, edging past the August peak of $14.306B. This surge coincides with the latest rally, as BTC has climbed from $108K to $124K, while open interest has expanded from $11.5B to $14.3B in just a few weeks. The parallel rise in both price and open interest confirms that the move has been powered by fresh inflows and new position openings, rather than a short-covering squeeze. This expansion highlights strong conviction from traders on both sides, with institutional and retail participation adding depth to the market. However, the sheer scale of leverage now in play introduces risk. Elevated open interest often acts as a double-edged sword: it can amplify upside moves as trapped shorts unwind, but it can just as quickly trigger liquidation cascades if price momentum stalls. For now, the structure favors continuation, with BTC pressing into new liquidity zones between $125K and $130K. Yet, the danger lies in the market’s fragility. If Bitcoin fails to extend higher and consolidates while open interest stays elevated, the likelihood of a sharp flush grows, potentially dragging price back toward key demand zones before the broader bullish trend resumes. In short, record-high open interest reflects both confidence and vulnerability. Traders should closely watch whether open interest continues rising or starts to unwind, as this will determine if the next leg extends smoothly into $130K or if a leverage-driven shakeout interrupts the rally.

        "url": "https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-massive-liquidity-inflows-boost-confidence-is-sol-next-to-hit-an-ath/",
        "body": "Solana (SOL) is trading at $227.69, holding steady after a week of heavy institutional inflows and rising market confidence. On-chain and derivatives data indicate a significant shift in market structure; institutions are becoming increasingly convinced, while retail remains cautious. Velo.data shows Solana futures open interest (OI) on CME has reached an all-time high of $2.16 billion, as price has rebounded 23% from $195 to $235. This institutional positioning is ahead of the Oct 10 SEC decision on a Solana based ETF. Timing suggests pros are positioning for a volatility spike. SOL CME futures data. Source: Velo.data CME’s annualized basis is 16.37%, down from 35% in July, so it’s not speculative. Retail OI across exchanges is flat and funding rates are near neutral. This is a clear picture — institutions are buying strength while retail is still recovering from the $307 million in liquidations on Sept 22, when longs worth $250 million were wiped out. This is a balanced yet bullish setup — institutional accumulation is building a base, while retail leverage remains low. Historically, this type of structure has led to a measured move up, rather than a blow-off top. Solana ETP Inflows Reinforce Confidence Another sign of institutional demand is the inflow into Solana ETPs. Total Solana ETP AUM has surpassed $500 million , led by the Solana Staking ETF (SSK) from REXShares, which has over $400 million AUM. The Bitwise Solana Staking ETP (BSOL) has surpassed $100 million in AUM, and both products have proliferated since their launch. This represents a structural shift in how investors gain exposure to Solana — from speculative trading to regulated products that offer yield-bearing exposure through staking. This is a sign of market maturity and confirms Solana is one of the most accumulated altcoins in 2025. These inflows also tighten up liquidity on the spot market, supporting price as supply on exchanges declines. With CME’s record futures activity, this means institutional positioning is increasingly driving the price of Solana. Solana Price Prediction – Technical Outlook Technically, Solana price prediction remains bullish as SOL is in a defined uptrend, trading at $227 after moving up from $205 last week. The 50 SMA ($214.50) and 100 SMA ($216.35) are below the price, indicating a bullish crossover and an intact trend. Candlesticks show smaller-bodied candles with upper wicks, consolidation after a big move. RSI is 55.9, so the market has cooled off and there’s room for another push higher. Resistance is at $237.00, then $244.85, with a potential target at $253.44 if momentum continues. For traders, the optimal setup is between $224 and $225, where the lower channel serves as a buy-the-dip zone. As long as Solana is above its moving averages, the broader bias is bullish, so SOL should be positioned for a breakout to new all-time highs in the coming months.

        "body": "Bitcoin continues to draw global attention as analysts keep projecting new highs before the end of the year. With institutional accumulation and retail adoption increasing, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is still set for further growth. Forecasts indicate that Bitcoin could soon clear resistance zones last seen in August, which is promising for the entire crypto sector. Yet, even while Bitcoin solidifies its dominance, investors are tapping the market for opportunities with a higher return potential. This search has pushed MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale project already gaining momentum. With the speculation of a listing price of $0.007, community-driven growth has led to talk of bringing 100x ROI in less than a year. Bitcoin (BTC) Holds Strong at $122K and Technical Indicators Bitcoin has risen by 2% in the last 24 hours, trading at $122,300 at press time. This extends a 12% weekly gain. The move outperformed the market-wide 1.9% rise by the overall crypto sector, cementing this coin’s status as a trendsetter. Source: CoinMarketCap Institutional activity continues to gain ground for Bitcoin’s case. Public miners Marathon Digital and CleanSpark increased their treasuries in September. CleanSpark added 184 BTC, and Marathon increased reserves to 52,850 BTC, worth $6.4 billion. Disposal by both firms featured minimal sales and an emphasis on accumulation. By this strategy, the circulating supply is reduced, signaling confidence in a long-term value. Marathon’s expansion into AI and data infrastructure offers resilience to its operations. With several sources of revenue, the company does not heavily rely on the liquidation of BTC. Such institutional positioning gives credence to Bitcoin as a store of value. Retail adoption is another driver. Walmart-backed fintech OnePay announced plans to integrate Bitcoin trading to its mobile app by late 2025. With access to Walmart’s 150 million weekly customers, Bitcoin could have new use cases in retail payments. Enabling crypto-to-fiat conversions at checkout facilitates a payment bridge like Cash App’s, which historically led to increased transaction-driven adoption. From a technical point of view, Bitcoin has regained the $120K, moving above its 7-day SMA & 30-day EMA. The MACD histogram exploded to +688, its strongest signal since August highs. RSI is at 66.48, which indicates there is still momentum before overbought conditions develop. Analysts are targeting Fibonacci extensions at $124,451 and then $128,733 as the next resistance levels. Sustained closes above $122K may clear the path to retesting August’s record high near $125K. MAGACOIN FINANCE Forecast to Deliver 100x ROI by Next Year While Bitcoin’s climb reinforces its role as the market’s anchor, investors are increasingly turning their attention to opportunities with higher upside. That search has brought MAGACOIN FINANCE into the spotlight. Trading at a low price, the project is being hailed as one of 2025’s most promising tokens, with forecasts projecting a staggering 100x return by next year. The contrast is clear. Bitcoin offers stability and institutional adoption, but MAGACOIN FINANCE appeals to those seeking exponential growth. Speculation around a potential exchange listing has only amplified the excitement, suggesting that early participants could benefit from a surge in liquidity and demand once trading begins. Community momentum adds another dimension. Investor groups across Telegram and X have been buzzing with updates and coordinated buying strategies, echoing the grassroots energy that has fueled past breakout tokens. For many retail participants, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the kind of l ow-cost, high-reward opportunity that Bitcoin once offered in its early years. As Bitcoin tests resistance near $125K, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its own narrative, one centered on accessibility and the possibility of turning small allocations into transformative gains within the next cycle. Conclusion Bitcoin’s resilience underscores its strength as a dominant market force. With institutional miners accumulating, retail adoption expanding, and bullish technical indicators, the coin remains well-positioned for growth. However, the upside is moderated by its large market cap, making exponential returns less likely compared to smaller tokens. That is where MAGACOIN FINANCE steps in. With a forecasted $0.007 listing price and strong community engagement, it presents a unique opportunity for outsized returns. For investors balancing stability and growth potential, combining Bitcoin’s resilience with MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive trajectory may shape one of the most compelling strategies of 2025.

        "body": "SOL is holding firm at $200 as it battles to stay afloat. Several factors suggest it could rebound soon. Besides Solana, two other projects are contending for dominance: Ripple (XRP) and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Each one of them is gaining significant attention in the crypto space. Their setup suggests that they could dominate in 2025. In this article, we will discuss each and find out which one will win in 2025. Solana (SOL): Institutional Magnet With Expanding On-Chain Utility Solana (SOL) trades near $203, after a pullback from earlier-month highs. However, on-chain activity remains robust. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) stands at around $13–14 billion, with healthy DEX and perpetual (perp) volumes supporting the network’s utility. Institutional flows have continued through the correction. The REX-Osprey Solana ETF experienced notable inflows of $65 million in mid-September, despite prices softening. Also, staking-oriented ETF products are expanding institutional access. Recent SEC rule changes have also lowered the bar for spot crypto ETFs, potentially accelerating product launches tied to SOL. Together, these factors suggest SOL could benefit if institutional allocation and on-chain demand persist. Ripple (XRP): Regulatory Clarity Meets Amidst Institutional Demand XRP trades near $2.80 as ETF optimism rises. It has recently partnered with DBS and Franklin Templeton to enable tokenized money-market fund trading on the XRP Ledger. This highlights institutional use cases beyond pure payments. The SEC’s September rule updates have also made multiple spot-ETF filings more feasible. This increases the odds of XRP-linked products and potential large inflows. Still, analysts caution that ETF approvals alone may not translate into sustained retail rallies unless institutional adoption leads to on-ledger volume and real-world flows. For instance, despite strong volume from the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF, XRP’s price has only fallen further below. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Culture Reinvented With Real Utility Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has positioned itself as a new frontier in meme tokens. It combines community-driven appeal with a solid technical foundation. Its presale, now in Stage 13, has already raised over $26.3 million and sold more than 16 billion tokens at $0.0022. This signals a strong early conviction among investors. Little Pepe is powered by Pepe Chain, an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 built for memes. The chain delivers low gas fees and fast finality. It also offers built-in protections against sniper bots. Its tokenomics are designed to reward sustainability. It includes zero buy/sell tax, staking mechanisms, and a share allocated for ecosystem growth. A key pillar is Pepe’s Pump Pad, the native launchpad that allows meme projects to deploy directly on the chain. Tokens launched via the pump pad help drive transaction volume, feeding demand back into LILPEPE itself. This creates a looping effect of utility and engagement. Credibility has been bolstered through a successful CertiK audit and listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. On the team side, Little Pepe is backed by anonymous experts with experience in meme project growth. This gives it a level of credibility that’s easily backed by its roadmap. Planned listings on two Tier-1 centralized exchanges at launch, along with future plans for the world’s largest exchange, could put LILPEPE in the spotlight as trading begins. Given its lower valuation, strong ecosystem design, and viral potential, Little Pepe may offer higher upside growth curves. SOL vs. XRP vs. LILPEPE: Which One Will Dominate in 2025? Solana offers institutional-grade security and broad infrastructure utilization. This makes it a reliable foundation for numerous blockchain applications. If demand for scalable smart contract platforms continues under regulatory clarity, SOL may capture substantial adoption. XRP’s strength lies in serving as a regulatory and institutional bridge—if legal frameworks favor financial token use cases, XRP could benefit strongly. Yet, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the wildcard. While SOL and XRP dominate with utility and legitimacy, LILPEPE blends memetic culture and core infrastructure, targeting the meme sector itself. In a cycle that may lean heavily on viral growth and novelty, LILPEPE could outperform in percentage gains. Analysts may see SOL capturing market share and XRP anchoring institutional flows. However, for raw upside, Little Pepe stands as the candidate with the most room to scale. Dominance depends on whether 2025 rewards infrastructure, regulation, or memetic innovation. And LILPEPE is best positioned if meme-utility fusion becomes the narrative. Conclusion Solana, Ripple, and Little Pepe each present a distinct path toward dominance in 2025. SOL combines infrastructure strength and adoption. On the other hand, XRP bridges financial legitimacy with crypto access. But it is Little Pepe that merges meme culture with technical depth, offering potentially explosive growth. Though it carries a higher risk, its robust presale performance, ecosystem development, and launchpad mechanics provide it with the framework to compete meaningfully. For investors seeking asymmetric upside in the meme sector, Little Pepe deserves serious consideration. Visit the Little Pepe website or join its Telegram to stay ahead of listings and developments.

        "body": "Crypto analyst Bobby revealed that the XRP price has completed a consolidation pattern, hinting at a potential parabolic rally for the altcoin soon. The analyst suggested that XRP’s price could rally to double digits once this rally occurs. XRP Price Eyes Rally To $19 As It Completes Double-Bottom Pattern In an X post, Bobby indicated that the XRP price has completed the macro double-bottom pattern, which it had spent over seven years building. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the altcoin is now gearing up for a rally to as high as $19 following the completion of this consolidation pattern. Related Reading: XRP Price Faces 25% Drawdown Risk, But This Technical Point Is Key Meanwhile, the analyst noted that the XRP price spent over nine months building support near the neckline of the massive W pattern. He added that the altcoin spent the same amount of time consolidating below the 1.618 Fibonacci extension of its latest macro swing high to swing low. Bobby indicated that the XRP price rally will begin once it breaks through $3.02 and gains monthly acceptance above that level. He expects this move to take XRP into the take-profit levels he has highlighted on several occasions. These levels include $4.7, $6.4, $7.4, and possibly $19, all of which mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for the altcoin. The analyst also predicts that the XRP ETFs could spark a rally to between $8 and $13 with possible wicks into the $20 range. These funds are expected to launch this month, depending on when the U.S. government shutdown ends. They provided a bullish outlook for XRP due to the amount of inflows that they could drive into the altcoin’s ecosystem. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that Bobby had also earlier alluded to previous cycles as the reason XRP could rally to $13. Analyst Sounds Warning To Bulls Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has warned XRP bulls that the XRP price needs to close above $3.13 to $3.20 on the 3-day chart to sustain the current bullish momentum. His warning followed XRP’s reclaim of the psychological $3 level, which he noted has wrecked the bears. However, the altcoin needs to close above this range, or the bulls are also in danger of getting wrecked. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Remains Bullish As This Level Holds Egrag Crypto stated that the XRP price could follow suit if Bitcoin and Ethereum get rejected on their current rallies. He added that the altcoin could head lower, which he believes might actually be better. He assured that the last impulsive move would be explosive and could lead to life-changing gains for the bulls. However, for now, he believes that XRP is simply ranging until it closes above $3.20. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from Tradingview.com",

        "body": "If you have $1,500 set aside for a high-potential crypto play, there is a fresh name that is catching the eye of early investors. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) built on Ethereum is not just another meme coin. It has already climbed more than 120% from its starting presale price and is currently offering about 36.36% projected gains before its public launch. At the time of writing, LILPEPE is priced at $0.0022 in Stage 13 of its presale, having raised an impressive $26.37 million out of a $28.77 million target. A meme coin with momentum Little Pepe is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about Ethereum meme coins of 2025. The token’s presale has been moving at an incredible pace, with more than 16.15 billion of its 17.25 billion tokens already sold. The presale price recently increased from $0.0021 to $0.0022, reflecting steady demand. This is no small feat considering that Stage 1 investors are already sitting on 120% gains while the presale still has six stages left. The project’s momentum is further boosted by its recent listing on CoinMarketCap and a Certik audit score of 95.49%, which strengthens investor confidence. Being both audited and trackable on a significant platform gives LILPEPE credibility that most meme coins lack. Why investors are watching LILPEPE closely The appeal of Little Pepe goes beyond just hype. It is positioning itself as a Layer 2 meme ecosystem that offers zero trading tax, anti-sniper bot protection, and plans for a meme launchpad and NFT marketplace. These features suggest that it aims to be more than a fleeting trend. Community engagement has been high, with the Team running a $777,000 giveaway and introducing a Mega Giveaway worth over 15 ETH in prizes for top presale buyers from Stage 12 to Stage 17. At a time when crypto markets are searching for the next breakout star after Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, LILPEPE’s strong presale and active rewards are pulling in attention from across the meme coin crowd. How LILPEPE stacks up against the big names As of the time of writing, DOGE trades around $0.12 while SHIB hovers near $0.000018. These meme coins still have strong communities but lack the fresh momentum that drives rapid price surges. Little Pepe has stepped into that gap with a lower entry price and a roadmap that blends meme culture with practical tools. The fact that LILPEPE peaked above PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB in ChatGPT’s memecoin search trends between June and August 2025 hints at rising retail interest. The potential upside For investors entering at Stage 13’s $0.0022 price, the token is expected to launch at $0.0030, offering a near-term 36.36% gain even before its first day of open trading. Early-stage buyers have already seen 120% gains, and the speculative talk of a 75x rally reflects hopes that it can catch a fraction of the market cap of DOGE or SHIB as it gains mainstream attention. Final thoughts If you are looking for a fresh entry into the meme coin market and have $1,500 to spare, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is worth a closer look. It combines meme culture with credible tech and is already rewarding early participants. With the presale selling out fast at the time of writing and still offering projected gains of 36.36% before launch, this could be a rare chance to enter early. The presale is nearing its final stages, and as history has shown with other meme sensations, the early days often present the biggest growth window.

        "body": "The U.S. government shut down this past Wednesday, furloughing any federal employees deemed non-essential and forcing the rest to work without pay (though they should receive backpay when the government is formally funded again). If the government reopens within the next few weeks, it shouldn't have too much of an effect on D.C.'s crypto policymaking. The longer the shutdown stretches, however, the more delayed crypto efforts will be. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Waiting for a reboot The narrative The government shut down on Wednesday, and at least as of press time, Democrats and Republicans do not appear to be close to a deal to reopen it. Why it matters As discussed in last week's newsletter , the immediate effects of the shutdown are pretty straightforward: Market structure legislation will likely be delayed, federal agencies' rulemaking will probably be delayed, and new spot crypto exchange-traded funds will not launch as many hoped in the coming days. If the shutdown is just a few days — or potentially as long as two weeks — these efforts should resume pretty seamlessly. If the shutdown goes beyond that, the picture becomes much muddier. Breaking it down The longest U.S. government shutdown in history took place between December 2018 and January 2019, during President Donald Trump's first term. At the time, Democrats controlled the House of Representatives while Republicans controlled the Senate. This latest shutdown is only a few days old as of press time, and could last just a few days or may stretch on further. Perhaps the most immediate and tangible effect of the government shutdown on crypto issues is on exchange-traded funds. The Securities and Exchange Commission was expected to allow ETFs tracking the prices of assets like Solana (SOL) and Litecoin (LTC) to launch this past week. While there was some movement last week and Monday, the clock ran out before all of the final paperwork could be pushed through, and the issuers have not yet been able to launch . The SEC was able to finalize a pair of no-action letters prior to the shutdown as well. Other agencies, like the IRS, were similarly able to publish interim guidance prior to the shutdown. Ron Hammond, head of Policy and Advocacy at Wintermute, told CoinDesk that, \"It can't be understated how busy the crypto policy developments have been.\" With the shutdown, policymakers are in limbo around these types of regulatory actions, he said. On the legislative front, one individual familiar with the dynamics in Washington, D.C. said that they do not expect the timeline for market structure legislation to change much should the shutdown end within the next two weeks or so. While lawmakers are looking to hold a possible markup — a hearing where lawmakers debate bills before potentially voting to advance them to the full Senate (or House) — by Oct. 20, 2025, this seems unlikely, regardless of when the shutdown ends, given they are still working on the text of the bill. Another individual familiar with these dynamics said an additional complicating factor for lawmakers and their staffers is the fact that the regulatory agencies they might consult with are currently furloughed, so the lawmakers writing the market structure bill won't be able to receive feedback or answers to any questions they might have for these federal regulators. Hammond said that December \"is still feasible\" for moving legislation through Congress at the moment. \"The longer this shutdown drags on, the more partisan bitterness seeps into the necessary bipartisan discourse on important topics like crypto market structure,\" Hammond said. \"Still, this shutdown drama isn't affecting our calculus on odds of market structure legislation chances of passing being more probable than not before the 2026 election ramps up.\" Hammond said he was watching to see if a markup in the Senate Banking and Agriculture Committees by Thanksgiving. This week This week There are no hearings or events being held by lawmakers this week around crypto.
