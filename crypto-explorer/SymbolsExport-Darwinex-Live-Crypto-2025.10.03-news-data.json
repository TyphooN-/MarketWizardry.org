        "body": "Defiance Investments filed a prospectus proposing 49 new 3X leveraged and inverse ETFs, including crypto-focused funds that track Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Robinhood, BitMine Immersion, Circle, Grayscale mini-trusts and a Solana ETF; the filing warns these 3X leveraged ETFs carry high short-term risk for aggressive traders. 49 proposed funds offering 3X long and inverse exposure Proposals include crypto firms, token-tracking ETFs, tech stocks and gold with explicit investor risk warnings. Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF demand helped spur filings; BTC ETFs hold roughly $150 billion in assets (CoinGlass data). 3X leveraged ETFs by Defiance Investments propose triple-long and inverse crypto and tech exposure; read the filing highlights and risk considerations — learn more now. What are Defiance Investments’ proposed 3X leveraged ETFs? Defiance Investments’ prospectus requests 49 new 3X leveraged and inverse ETFs , offering triple daily exposure to crypto firms, token-linked ETFs and select tech names. The filing lists single-stock, ETF and crypto ETP targets and repeatedly warns these funds are suited only for aggressive, short-term traders. How do the proposed 3X leveraged crypto ETFs differ from existing 2X products? Three-times leveraged ETFs aim to deliver approximately 3X the daily return of an underlying asset, versus 2X funds that seek double daily moves. Because leverage compounds daily, 3X funds amplify volatility and path dependency, increasing the chance of significant losses over multi-day holding periods. Regulators and market analysts have expressed caution. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Defiance files for 49 3X leveraged ETFs, including crypto and tech exposures\", \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-03T00:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-03T00:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png\" } }, \"description\": \"Defiance Investments proposed 49 new 3X leveraged and inverse ETFs covering crypto firms, token-tracking ETFs and tech names, with explicit risk disclosures for short-term traders.\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/articles/defiance-49-3x-etfs-prospectus\" }} Why did Defiance target crypto firms and token ETFs with 3X leverage? Defiance targeted crypto firms and token-linked ETFs to meet rising investor demand for direct and derivative exposure to digital assets. The surge in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows — with Bitcoin-related funds commanding sizable assets according to CoinGlass — encouraged issuers to explore leveraged versions despite higher risk. What specific companies and token ETFs are named in the filing? The prospectus lists funds tied to Coinbase, MicroStrategy (Bitcoin treasury exposure), Robinhood, BitMine Immersion (Ethereum treasury exposure), Circle (USDC issuer), Grayscale mini-trust ETFs tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum, and a Solana ETF from Volatility Shares. The filing proposes both 3X long and 3X inverse share classes for many of these exposures.

Recent filings — including Defiance’s — indicate the SEC is receiving applications for higher-leverage products. Market analysts, such as ETF.com senior analyst Sumit Roy, note the regulator may permit more volatile products, but approvals will depend on disclosures, structure and investor-protection considerations. How should investors evaluate proposed 3X leveraged ETFs? Evaluate leverage objectives, daily rebalancing mechanics, expense ratios, underlying liquidity, and prospectus risk disclosures. Compare historical one-day return replication and understand compounding effects for multi-day holdings. These funds are primarily for experienced, short-term traders. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to evaluate a 3X leveraged ETF\", \"description\": \"Steps to assess whether a 3X leveraged ETF aligns with a trader's objectives and risk tolerance.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Read the prospectus\", \"text\": \"Review leverage goal, daily reset rules, and risk warnings contained in the fund's prospectus.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Analyze volatility and liquidity\", \"text\": \"Check historical intraday and daily volatility of the underlying asset and the ETF's trading volume.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Simulate multi-day scenarios\", \"text\": \"Model multi-day returns to understand compounding effects and potential drawdowns for holding periods beyond one day.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Compare costs\", \"text\": \"Compare expense ratios and transaction costs relative to alternative exposure methods.\" } ]} Key Takeaways Defiance filed for 49 3X ETFs : Proposals include crypto firms, token ETFs and tech stocks, with both long and inverse classes. Higher leverage increases risk : 3X daily leverage amplifies volatility and can produce large multi-day divergences from expected returns. Investor due diligence required : Read prospectuses, assess liquidity and model compounding before trading these products. Conclusion The Defiance prospectus signals a push to expand 3X leveraged ETFs across crypto and tech exposures, reflecting issuer interest in meeting aggressive trader demand. 3X leveraged ETFs may arrive if approved, but their complexity and high risk make careful evaluation essential. Monitor regulatory decisions and read fund disclosures before trading. NEW: @Defiance_ETFs has just filed for just shy of 50 3X levered ETFs. Some on single stocks, some on other ETFs, some on crypto ETPs. Things are getting wild. — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) October 3, 2025 By: COINOTAG • Published: 2025-10-03 • Updated: 2025-10-03 Sources referenced in reporting: Defiance Investments prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; commentary from Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart; data from CoinGlass; analysis quotes from ETF.com senior analyst Sumit Roy.",

        "body": "Blockchain network revenue fell 16% month-over-month in September as reduced crypto volatility lowered demand for high-priority transactions, driving network fees down across major chains such as Ethereum, Solana and Tron. Network revenue fell 16% MoM in September Ethereum fees down 6%, Solana down 11%, Tron fees dropped 37% after a governance fee cut. Volatility fell sharply: ETH -40%, SOL -16%, BTC -26% — reducing arbitrage-driven fee demand. Blockchain network revenue fell 16% in September due to lower crypto volatility; read the full analysis, data, and investor takeaways. Learn how fees and fundamentals changed. Asset manager VanEck attributed the broad decline in blockchain network revenue in September to lower volatility in the crypto markets. What caused the decline in blockchain network revenue in September? Blockchain network revenue declined 16% month-over-month in September primarily because lower crypto volatility reduced traders’ need to pay priority fees, decreasing total fees across major networks. VanEck’s analysis cites reduced arbitrage and fewer high-priority transactions as the main drivers. VanEck reported that overall network revenues across the blockchain ecosystem dropped by 16% month-over-month in September, linked to diminished volatility and lower transaction fee demand. Ethereum network revenue fell by 6% and Solana’s by 11%. The Tron network recorded a 37% reduction in fees, which VanEck attributes to a governance proposal that halved gas fees in August. Most cryptocurrencies experienced reduced volatility in September. Source: VanEck How did volatility changes affect crypto network fees? Reduced volatility curtailed arbitrage and time-sensitive trading that typically pushes users to pay higher fees for faster settlement. Ether (ETH) volatility dropped about 40% in September, SOL volatility fell 16%, and BTC volatility declined 26%, according to VanEck’s figures. Lower volatility means fewer rapid price moves and thus fewer priority transactions, translating directly into lower network revenue and smaller fee pools for validators and miners. Why did Tron lead revenue metrics despite lower fees? Tron remains the top revenue-generating crypto ecosystem, producing roughly $3.6 billion over the last year, according to Token Terminal data cited in market reporting. This leadership stems largely from stablecoin activity — 51% of circulating Tether USDt supply is issued on the Tron network. A comparison of crypto network fees over the last year. Source: Token Terminal By comparison, Ethereum generated about $1 billion in annual revenue despite ETH reaching all-time highs in August and a market capitalization near $539 billion — roughly 16x TRX’s market cap of about $32 billion. Stablecoins continue to expand: the stablecoin market cap crossed $292 billion in October 2025, per RWA.XYZ data, reinforcing Tron’s role in settlement and recurring fee generation. How should investors interpret network revenue and fees? Network revenues and fees are a core metric for assessing blockchain economic activity and protocol health. Monitor fees as a short-term gauge of transaction demand and revenue as a longer-term indicator of platform monetization and product fit. Analysts track fundamentals such as active addresses, transaction value, and fee revenue to evaluate project trajectories and ecosystem resilience. Frequently Asked Questions How large was the month-over-month revenue decline in September? The blockchain ecosystem saw a 16% month-over-month decline in network revenue in September, driven largely by reduced volatility and lower priority-fee transactions. Did any networks buck the trend in September? Tron continued to lead annual revenue generation despite a 37% monthly fee drop, thanks to heavy stablecoin settlement activity and prior fee-structure changes. What role did governance changes play in fee reductions? On Tron, a governance proposal reduced gas fees by over 50% in August, contributing to a 37% drop in network fees in September as reflected in revenue data. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"What caused the decline in blockchain network revenue in September?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Reduced crypto volatility lowered arbitrage and priority-fee demand, leading to a 16% month-over-month decline in blockchain network revenue in September.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Why did Tron still lead revenue metrics?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Tron generated the most annual revenue due to heavy stablecoin settlement activity, with 51% of circulating USDT issued on Tron, supporting recurring fee volume.\" } } ]} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Blockchain network revenue drops in September as volatility falls\", \"description\": \"VanEck reports a 16% month-over-month decline in blockchain network revenue in September driven by reduced crypto volatility and lower transaction fees.\", \"image\": [\"https://en.coinotag.com/images/0199b0f3-c6e7-7260-b34f-183b28f6d0b8\"], \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-04T08:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-04T08:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png\" } }, \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com\" }} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to interpret a drop in blockchain network revenue\", \"description\": \"A brief step-by-step guide for investors to assess causes and implications of falling network fees and revenue.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Check volatility metrics\", \"text\": \"Compare ETH, SOL, and BTC volatility changes to see if lower price swings explain fee reductions.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Review protocol governance changes\", \"text\": \"Identify recent fee-structure proposals, such as Tron’s gas fee cut, which can materially reduce revenue.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Analyze stablecoin flows\", \"text\": \"Assess stablecoin issuance and settlement trends, as stablecoin volume can sustain fee revenue even in low-volatility markets.\" } ]} Key Takeaways Revenue decline: A 16% MoM drop in September shows fees are sensitive to volatility and governance changes. Network leaders: Tron leads annual revenue ($3.6B) due to stablecoin settlement dominance; Ethereum earned ~$1B. Investor action: Monitor volatility, fee policy changes, and stablecoin flows to assess short- and long-term revenue trends. Conclusion September’s 16% fall in blockchain network revenue reflects lower crypto volatility and targeted protocol changes that cut fees. Investors should combine fee analytics with on-chain activity and stablecoin trends to evaluate ecosystem health. Review network fundamentals regularly to inform allocation and risk decisions.",

        "body": "Asset management giant VanEck has published its cryptocurrency market report for September 2025. The report noted that Digital Asset Treasuries (DAT) holdings have reached approximately $135 billion, with institutional investors, in particular, continuing to accumulate and stake ETH. VanEck noted that this creates a dilution risk for investors outside of staking. The report also touched on Ethereum's upcoming Fusaka upgrade in December. This update is expected to reduce Layer-2 rollup costs by increasing blob capacity and improve network efficiency by allowing nodes to perform block validation using probabilistic sampling. According to VanEck's report, 23 of the 35 major tokens closed the month lower. Bitcoin (BTC) rose 5%, while Ethereum (ETH) fell 5%. The overall decline in market volatility has dampened both price action and blockchain revenue, causing stagnation in the sector. According to the report, blockchain revenues fell by 16% month-over-month: Ethereum revenues: -6% Solana revenues: -11% Tron revenues: -37% VanEck stated that the primary reason for this decline was the decrease in market volatility. In September, volatility fell by -40% for ETH, -26% for BTC, and -16% for SOL. While decentralized spot exchange (DEX) volumes remained at August levels of approximately $365 billion, futures volumes increased by 30%. Much of this increase was driven by the token launch of the Aster platform within the Binance ecosystem and incentivized trading pairs.

Top performing tokens in September: Mantle (MNT): +53% Avalanche (AVAX): +24% Binance Coin (BNB): +16% The weakest performers are: Polygon (POL): -19% Arbitrum (ARB): -17% Toncoin (TON): -14% VanEck noted that since 2016, September has generally been marked by negative returns. On average, Bitcoin loses 3% of its value in September, while Ethereum loses 7%. The year 2025 is no exception to this historical trend. *This is not investment advice.

Source: tradingview Dogecoin is currently trading between twenty-two and twenty-six cents. Its recent upward trend has seen a price surge of over 15% this week and nearly 20% for the month. The coin's momentum hints at breaking through the nearest resistance level of about twenty-eight cents. If it continues this path, it might soon challenge the second resistance level of roughly thirty-two cents. This could signal a potential growth of over 25%.

Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post.

Its current price range swings between a few thousandths of a cent, landing at around $0.000009. Despite it passing a week with almost a 9% rise, the momentum is cautious. It's below the 10-day moving average but slightly above the 100-day average, which points to stable but slow progress. If Pepe breaks the nearest resistance level, it could see a growth of about 15% from its current spot. However, dropping below support could mean a slide of 20%. With its RSI below 50, Pepe’s current potential leans more towards recovery than rapid growth. Conclusion DOGE and PEPE have both shown potential for growth. DOGE remains popular with a strong community backing. PEPE has recently gained attention due to its memes and social media trends. If interest in meme coins continues, both could see price increases. However, market dynamics always play a big role. Keeping an eye on market trends and investor interest is crucial for predicting future movements of these coins.

        "body": "Defiance Investments filed a prospectus proposing 49 new 3X leveraged and inverse ETFs, including crypto-focused funds that track Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Robinhood, BitMine Immersion, Circle, Grayscale mini-trusts and a Solana ETF; the filing warns these 3X leveraged ETFs carry high short-term risk for aggressive traders. 49 proposed funds offering 3X long and inverse exposure Proposals include crypto firms, token-tracking ETFs, tech stocks and gold with explicit investor risk warnings. Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF demand helped spur filings; BTC ETFs hold roughly $150 billion in assets (CoinGlass data). 3X leveraged ETFs by Defiance Investments propose triple-long and inverse crypto and tech exposure; read the filing highlights and risk considerations — learn more now. What are Defiance Investments’ proposed 3X leveraged ETFs? Defiance Investments’ prospectus requests 49 new 3X leveraged and inverse ETFs , offering triple daily exposure to crypto firms, token-linked ETFs and select tech names. The filing lists single-stock, ETF and crypto ETP targets and repeatedly warns these funds are suited only for aggressive, short-term traders. How do the proposed 3X leveraged crypto ETFs differ from existing 2X products? Three-times leveraged ETFs aim to deliver approximately 3X the daily return of an underlying asset, versus 2X funds that seek double daily moves. Because leverage compounds daily, 3X funds amplify volatility and path dependency, increasing the chance of significant losses over multi-day holding periods. Regulators and market analysts have expressed caution. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Defiance files for 49 3X leveraged ETFs, including crypto and tech exposures\", \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-03T00:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-03T00:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png\" } }, \"description\": \"Defiance Investments proposed 49 new 3X leveraged and inverse ETFs covering crypto firms, token-tracking ETFs and tech names, with explicit risk disclosures for short-term traders.\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/articles/defiance-49-3x-etfs-prospectus\" }} Why did Defiance target crypto firms and token ETFs with 3X leverage? Defiance targeted crypto firms and token-linked ETFs to meet rising investor demand for direct and derivative exposure to digital assets. The surge in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows — with Bitcoin-related funds commanding sizable assets according to CoinGlass — encouraged issuers to explore leveraged versions despite higher risk. What specific companies and token ETFs are named in the filing? The prospectus lists funds tied to Coinbase, MicroStrategy (Bitcoin treasury exposure), Robinhood, BitMine Immersion (Ethereum treasury exposure), Circle (USDC issuer), Grayscale mini-trust ETFs tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum, and a Solana ETF from Volatility Shares. The filing proposes both 3X long and 3X inverse share classes for many of these exposures.

Recent filings — including Defiance’s — indicate the SEC is receiving applications for higher-leverage products. Market analysts, such as ETF.com senior analyst Sumit Roy, note the regulator may permit more volatile products, but approvals will depend on disclosures, structure and investor-protection considerations. How should investors evaluate proposed 3X leveraged ETFs? Evaluate leverage objectives, daily rebalancing mechanics, expense ratios, underlying liquidity, and prospectus risk disclosures. Compare historical one-day return replication and understand compounding effects for multi-day holdings. These funds are primarily for experienced, short-term traders. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to evaluate a 3X leveraged ETF\", \"description\": \"Steps to assess whether a 3X leveraged ETF aligns with a trader's objectives and risk tolerance.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Read the prospectus\", \"text\": \"Review leverage goal, daily reset rules, and risk warnings contained in the fund's prospectus.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Analyze volatility and liquidity\", \"text\": \"Check historical intraday and daily volatility of the underlying asset and the ETF's trading volume.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Simulate multi-day scenarios\", \"text\": \"Model multi-day returns to understand compounding effects and potential drawdowns for holding periods beyond one day.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Compare costs\", \"text\": \"Compare expense ratios and transaction costs relative to alternative exposure methods.\" } ]} Key Takeaways Defiance filed for 49 3X ETFs : Proposals include crypto firms, token ETFs and tech stocks, with both long and inverse classes. Higher leverage increases risk : 3X daily leverage amplifies volatility and can produce large multi-day divergences from expected returns. Investor due diligence required : Read prospectuses, assess liquidity and model compounding before trading these products. Conclusion The Defiance prospectus signals a push to expand 3X leveraged ETFs across crypto and tech exposures, reflecting issuer interest in meeting aggressive trader demand. 3X leveraged ETFs may arrive if approved, but their complexity and high risk make careful evaluation essential. Monitor regulatory decisions and read fund disclosures before trading. NEW: @Defiance_ETFs has just filed for just shy of 50 3X levered ETFs. Some on single stocks, some on other ETFs, some on crypto ETPs. Things are getting wild. — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) October 3, 2025 By: COINOTAG • Published: 2025-10-03 • Updated: 2025-10-03 Sources referenced in reporting: Defiance Investments prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; commentary from Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart; data from CoinGlass; analysis quotes from ETF.com senior analyst Sumit Roy.",

        "body": "Blockchain network revenue fell 16% month-over-month in September as reduced crypto volatility lowered demand for high-priority transactions, driving network fees down across major chains such as Ethereum, Solana and Tron. Network revenue fell 16% MoM in September Ethereum fees down 6%, Solana down 11%, Tron fees dropped 37% after a governance fee cut. Volatility fell sharply: ETH -40%, SOL -16%, BTC -26% — reducing arbitrage-driven fee demand. Blockchain network revenue fell 16% in September due to lower crypto volatility; read the full analysis, data, and investor takeaways. Learn how fees and fundamentals changed. Asset manager VanEck attributed the broad decline in blockchain network revenue in September to lower volatility in the crypto markets. What caused the decline in blockchain network revenue in September? Blockchain network revenue declined 16% month-over-month in September primarily because lower crypto volatility reduced traders’ need to pay priority fees, decreasing total fees across major networks. VanEck’s analysis cites reduced arbitrage and fewer high-priority transactions as the main drivers. VanEck reported that overall network revenues across the blockchain ecosystem dropped by 16% month-over-month in September, linked to diminished volatility and lower transaction fee demand. Ethereum network revenue fell by 6% and Solana’s by 11%. The Tron network recorded a 37% reduction in fees, which VanEck attributes to a governance proposal that halved gas fees in August. Most cryptocurrencies experienced reduced volatility in September. Source: VanEck How did volatility changes affect crypto network fees? Reduced volatility curtailed arbitrage and time-sensitive trading that typically pushes users to pay higher fees for faster settlement. Ether (ETH) volatility dropped about 40% in September, SOL volatility fell 16%, and BTC volatility declined 26%, according to VanEck’s figures. Lower volatility means fewer rapid price moves and thus fewer priority transactions, translating directly into lower network revenue and smaller fee pools for validators and miners. Why did Tron lead revenue metrics despite lower fees? Tron remains the top revenue-generating crypto ecosystem, producing roughly $3.6 billion over the last year, according to Token Terminal data cited in market reporting. This leadership stems largely from stablecoin activity — 51% of circulating Tether USDt supply is issued on the Tron network. A comparison of crypto network fees over the last year. Source: Token Terminal By comparison, Ethereum generated about $1 billion in annual revenue despite ETH reaching all-time highs in August and a market capitalization near $539 billion — roughly 16x TRX’s market cap of about $32 billion. Stablecoins continue to expand: the stablecoin market cap crossed $292 billion in October 2025, per RWA.XYZ data, reinforcing Tron’s role in settlement and recurring fee generation. How should investors interpret network revenue and fees? Network revenues and fees are a core metric for assessing blockchain economic activity and protocol health. Monitor fees as a short-term gauge of transaction demand and revenue as a longer-term indicator of platform monetization and product fit. Analysts track fundamentals such as active addresses, transaction value, and fee revenue to evaluate project trajectories and ecosystem resilience. Frequently Asked Questions How large was the month-over-month revenue decline in September? The blockchain ecosystem saw a 16% month-over-month decline in network revenue in September, driven largely by reduced volatility and lower priority-fee transactions. Did any networks buck the trend in September? Tron continued to lead annual revenue generation despite a 37% monthly fee drop, thanks to heavy stablecoin settlement activity and prior fee-structure changes. What role did governance changes play in fee reductions? On Tron, a governance proposal reduced gas fees by over 50% in August, contributing to a 37% drop in network fees in September as reflected in revenue data. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"What caused the decline in blockchain network revenue in September?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Reduced crypto volatility lowered arbitrage and priority-fee demand, leading to a 16% month-over-month decline in blockchain network revenue in September.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Why did Tron still lead revenue metrics?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Tron generated the most annual revenue due to heavy stablecoin settlement activity, with 51% of circulating USDT issued on Tron, supporting recurring fee volume.\" } } ]} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Blockchain network revenue drops in September as volatility falls\", \"description\": \"VanEck reports a 16% month-over-month decline in blockchain network revenue in September driven by reduced crypto volatility and lower transaction fees.\", \"image\": [\"https://en.coinotag.com/images/0199b0f3-c6e7-7260-b34f-183b28f6d0b8\"], \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-04T08:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-04T08:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png\" } }, \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com\" }} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to interpret a drop in blockchain network revenue\", \"description\": \"A brief step-by-step guide for investors to assess causes and implications of falling network fees and revenue.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Check volatility metrics\", \"text\": \"Compare ETH, SOL, and BTC volatility changes to see if lower price swings explain fee reductions.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Review protocol governance changes\", \"text\": \"Identify recent fee-structure proposals, such as Tron’s gas fee cut, which can materially reduce revenue.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Analyze stablecoin flows\", \"text\": \"Assess stablecoin issuance and settlement trends, as stablecoin volume can sustain fee revenue even in low-volatility markets.\" } ]} Key Takeaways Revenue decline: A 16% MoM drop in September shows fees are sensitive to volatility and governance changes. Network leaders: Tron leads annual revenue ($3.6B) due to stablecoin settlement dominance; Ethereum earned ~$1B. Investor action: Monitor volatility, fee policy changes, and stablecoin flows to assess short- and long-term revenue trends. Conclusion September’s 16% fall in blockchain network revenue reflects lower crypto volatility and targeted protocol changes that cut fees. Investors should combine fee analytics with on-chain activity and stablecoin trends to evaluate ecosystem health. Review network fundamentals regularly to inform allocation and risk decisions.",

        "body": "Asset management giant VanEck has published its cryptocurrency market report for September 2025. The report noted that Digital Asset Treasuries (DAT) holdings have reached approximately $135 billion, with institutional investors, in particular, continuing to accumulate and stake ETH. VanEck noted that this creates a dilution risk for investors outside of staking. The report also touched on Ethereum's upcoming Fusaka upgrade in December. This update is expected to reduce Layer-2 rollup costs by increasing blob capacity and improve network efficiency by allowing nodes to perform block validation using probabilistic sampling. According to VanEck's report, 23 of the 35 major tokens closed the month lower. Bitcoin (BTC) rose 5%, while Ethereum (ETH) fell 5%. The overall decline in market volatility has dampened both price action and blockchain revenue, causing stagnation in the sector. According to the report, blockchain revenues fell by 16% month-over-month: Ethereum revenues: -6% Solana revenues: -11% Tron revenues: -37% VanEck stated that the primary reason for this decline was the decrease in market volatility. In September, volatility fell by -40% for ETH, -26% for BTC, and -16% for SOL. While decentralized spot exchange (DEX) volumes remained at August levels of approximately $365 billion, futures volumes increased by 30%. Much of this increase was driven by the token launch of the Aster platform within the Binance ecosystem and incentivized trading pairs.

Top performing tokens in September: Mantle (MNT): +53% Avalanche (AVAX): +24% Binance Coin (BNB): +16% The weakest performers are: Polygon (POL): -19% Arbitrum (ARB): -17% Toncoin (TON): -14% VanEck noted that since 2016, September has generally been marked by negative returns. On average, Bitcoin loses 3% of its value in September, while Ethereum loses 7%. The year 2025 is no exception to this historical trend. *This is not investment advice.

REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs are proposed funds that would hold and stake selected proof-of-stake tokens, paying staking rewards to the ETF while tracking token price movements. The filings name tokens such as ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SEI and SUI and outline use of Cayman subsidiaries to meet regulatory and tax requirements. How do these ETFs combine yield and price exposure? The funds are structured to both participate in on-chain staking (generating rewards) and provide market exposure to token price changes. Staking rewards would be retained or distributed according to each fund’s prospectus. Issuers emphasize the ability to deliver staking yield without investors directly managing private keys. Why is the SEC review delayed and what are the regulatory implications? The SEC’s standard review period for ETF filings is approximately 75 days, but reduced staffing from the government shutdown has slowed processing. Past shutdowns, such as in 2018, caused notable approval delays; analysts expect a similar impact now. Any approvals will still need to satisfy custody, custody-provider oversight, and compliance requirements for staking activities. Which tokens and issuers are named in filings? Filings list staked tokens including ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SEI, SUI, TAO and HYPE. The documents reference allocation flexibility allowing up to 40% of fund assets to be invested in non-U.S. exchange-traded products from issuers named in plain text: 21Shares, CoinShares and Valour. Issuers plan Cayman Islands feeder structures to preserve regulated investment company status under U.S. tax rules. How might investor exposure differ compared to existing spot ETFs? Staking crypto ETFs differ from spot ETFs by adding a yield component from protocol-level staking. Investors gain passive yield (subject to slashing and validator performance) in addition to price appreciation or depreciation. The funds aim to reduce operational friction for institutional investors while preserving tradability on U.S. exchanges. Summary comparison of proposed ETFs (example allocation) ETF Primary Token Staking Enabled Potential Non‑U.S. Allocation Target Investor REX-Osprey ADA Staked ETF ADA Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional REX-Osprey AVAX Staked ETF AVAX Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional REX-Osprey NEAR Staked ETF NEAR Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional When could decisions resume and what should investors watch? Approvals are likely to resume once full SEC operations return; October 2025 is noted as a key month for several pending crypto ETF deadlines. Investors should monitor SEC notices, prospectus amendments, and custody disclosures for staking mechanics, fee schedules, and counterparty arrangements. Frequently Asked Questions Will staking ETFs increase investor access to altcoins? Yes. Staking ETFs aim to broaden access by allowing investors to gain price and yield exposure through regulated vehicles, avoiding direct custody and staking complexities. Product terms will determine yield distribution and fee impact. Can fund assets be invested in non-U.S. ETPs? Yes. Filings state up to 40% of a fund’s assets may be invested in non-U.S. crypto exchange-traded products from issuers referenced in the filings. This may diversify access to European and Canadian markets within a U.S.-listed wrapper. Are staking rewards guaranteed? No. Staking rewards depend on network conditions, validator performance and protocol rules. Rewards can fluctuate and may be subject to penalties such as slashing for misbehavior or downtime. Key Takeaways Regulatory review active : The SEC is reviewing 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETF filings; approval timelines are delayed by a government shutdown. Yield + market exposure : Proposed ETFs combine staking rewards with token price exposure for altcoins like ADA, AVAX and NEAR. Cross-border allocation : Up to 40% non-U.S. ETP allocation may link funds to international issuers while using Cayman subsidiaries for tax and regulatory alignment. Conclusion The SEC’s review of staking crypto ETFs from REX and Osprey could expand regulated yield-bearing access to major altcoins, but approval timing remains uncertain due to the government shutdown.

        "body": "Defiance Investments filed a prospectus proposing 49 new 3X leveraged and inverse ETFs, including crypto-focused funds that track Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Robinhood, BitMine Immersion, Circle, Grayscale mini-trusts and a Solana ETF; the filing warns these 3X leveraged ETFs carry high short-term risk for aggressive traders. 49 proposed funds offering 3X long and inverse exposure Proposals include crypto firms, token-tracking ETFs, tech stocks and gold with explicit investor risk warnings. Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF demand helped spur filings; BTC ETFs hold roughly $150 billion in assets (CoinGlass data). 3X leveraged ETFs by Defiance Investments propose triple-long and inverse crypto and tech exposure; read the filing highlights and risk considerations — learn more now. What are Defiance Investments’ proposed 3X leveraged ETFs? Defiance Investments’ prospectus requests 49 new 3X leveraged and inverse ETFs , offering triple daily exposure to crypto firms, token-linked ETFs and select tech names. The filing lists single-stock, ETF and crypto ETP targets and repeatedly warns these funds are suited only for aggressive, short-term traders. How do the proposed 3X leveraged crypto ETFs differ from existing 2X products? Three-times leveraged ETFs aim to deliver approximately 3X the daily return of an underlying asset, versus 2X funds that seek double daily moves. Because leverage compounds daily, 3X funds amplify volatility and path dependency, increasing the chance of significant losses over multi-day holding periods. Regulators and market analysts have expressed caution. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Defiance files for 49 3X leveraged ETFs, including crypto and tech exposures\", \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-03T00:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-03T00:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png\" } }, \"description\": \"Defiance Investments proposed 49 new 3X leveraged and inverse ETFs covering crypto firms, token-tracking ETFs and tech names, with explicit risk disclosures for short-term traders.\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/articles/defiance-49-3x-etfs-prospectus\" }} Why did Defiance target crypto firms and token ETFs with 3X leverage? Defiance targeted crypto firms and token-linked ETFs to meet rising investor demand for direct and derivative exposure to digital assets. The surge in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows — with Bitcoin-related funds commanding sizable assets according to CoinGlass — encouraged issuers to explore leveraged versions despite higher risk. What specific companies and token ETFs are named in the filing? The prospectus lists funds tied to Coinbase, MicroStrategy (Bitcoin treasury exposure), Robinhood, BitMine Immersion (Ethereum treasury exposure), Circle (USDC issuer), Grayscale mini-trust ETFs tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum, and a Solana ETF from Volatility Shares. The filing proposes both 3X long and 3X inverse share classes for many of these exposures.

Recent filings — including Defiance’s — indicate the SEC is receiving applications for higher-leverage products. Market analysts, such as ETF.com senior analyst Sumit Roy, note the regulator may permit more volatile products, but approvals will depend on disclosures, structure and investor-protection considerations. How should investors evaluate proposed 3X leveraged ETFs? Evaluate leverage objectives, daily rebalancing mechanics, expense ratios, underlying liquidity, and prospectus risk disclosures. Compare historical one-day return replication and understand compounding effects for multi-day holdings. These funds are primarily for experienced, short-term traders. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to evaluate a 3X leveraged ETF\", \"description\": \"Steps to assess whether a 3X leveraged ETF aligns with a trader's objectives and risk tolerance.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Read the prospectus\", \"text\": \"Review leverage goal, daily reset rules, and risk warnings contained in the fund's prospectus.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Analyze volatility and liquidity\", \"text\": \"Check historical intraday and daily volatility of the underlying asset and the ETF's trading volume.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Simulate multi-day scenarios\", \"text\": \"Model multi-day returns to understand compounding effects and potential drawdowns for holding periods beyond one day.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Compare costs\", \"text\": \"Compare expense ratios and transaction costs relative to alternative exposure methods.\" } ]} Key Takeaways Defiance filed for 49 3X ETFs : Proposals include crypto firms, token ETFs and tech stocks, with both long and inverse classes. Higher leverage increases risk : 3X daily leverage amplifies volatility and can produce large multi-day divergences from expected returns. Investor due diligence required : Read prospectuses, assess liquidity and model compounding before trading these products. Conclusion The Defiance prospectus signals a push to expand 3X leveraged ETFs across crypto and tech exposures, reflecting issuer interest in meeting aggressive trader demand. 3X leveraged ETFs may arrive if approved, but their complexity and high risk make careful evaluation essential. Monitor regulatory decisions and read fund disclosures before trading. NEW: @Defiance_ETFs has just filed for just shy of 50 3X levered ETFs. Some on single stocks, some on other ETFs, some on crypto ETPs.

        "body": "Cardano (ADA) continues to capture attention as it edges closer to a crucial resistance level. With recent price gains and steady market momentum, many are wondering if ADA can finally break through the barrier and push beyond the dollar mark. This article looks at the key indicators shaping ADA’s next move—and also highlights how Outset PR applies data-driven clarity to help crypto projects, much like ADA itself, position for lasting growth in a competitive environment. Cardano on the Rise: Potential Growth Amidst Recent Gains Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) is on an upward swing, trading between about 75 to 88 cents. In the past week alone, its price has jumped over 12%. Heading towards the 95-cent resistance mark, Cardano shows promise. If it breaks this barrier, it could target a rise beyond one dollar, which implies a sharp climb. Over the last six months, Cardano has seen a growth of over 31%. Key support at around 69 cents could act as a cushion if prices dip. With a relative strength index near 50, Cardano seems balanced between overbought and oversold, suggesting room for potential further upward movement.

        "url": "https://timestabloid.com/heres-what-xrp-market-cap-multiplier-effect-means/",
        "body": "Every crypto bull market has its buzzwords, but few have sparked as much curiosity among XRP holders as the so-called “market cap multiplier effect.” It’s the idea that XRP’s true price potential isn’t limited by its large total supply — because only a fraction of that supply is actively available on the market. In other words, XRP’s liquidity reality may be far smaller than its theoretical supply, meaning smaller inflows of capital could trigger disproportionately large price reactions. Understanding the Market Cap Multiplier In a recent video, Jake Claver, managing partner at Digital Wealth Partners, tackled the growing debate head-on: “People look at total supply of XRP when, in reality, the supply-demand dynamics are going to be on the available supply of XRP,” he explained. This distinction — between XRP’s total supply of 100 billion and the much smaller circulating amount that actually trades — is at the heart of the multiplier effect. Let's look at what the XRP market cap multiplier effect means pic.twitter.com/5tiUdpHt6i — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) October 3, 2025 Claver illustrated this with a practical example: “There might be 2 billion XRP left on exchanges — probably less than that if you include retail and what they’re going to exit or sell.” He added that even if XRP’s price skyrockets to $10, $20, or even $50, some retail investors would inevitably sell portions of their holdings, adding perhaps another billion XRP to the liquid market. But that still represents a small share of total supply. The Math Behind the Multiplier Claver broke down the logic simply: “If you only had, let’s say, 2 billion [XRP] out of 100 billion, you’d be that 50x that Zach Rector talks about. It’s total supply versus available supply — and that’s why you get a shift in how much liquidity moving in is going to cause the market cap to rise in a multiplier effect.” When buyers enter the market, their demand impacts a smaller pool of available tokens, rather than the total supply. This limited float magnifies price movements, which in turn amplifies market capitalization faster than would occur in a fully distributed asset. Institutional Holdings and Market Liquidity Claver also revealed that his firm, Digital Wealth Partners, currently manages around 200 million XRP, accounting for roughly 8% of retail-owned XRP, based on his estimates. This institutional custody further concentrates holdings, reducing the amount of XRP readily available on exchanges. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 “Retail doesn’t hold more than maybe 1.2 to 2 billion total XRP in my opinion,” he said, emphasizing that these liquidity dynamics are critical for understanding XRP’s future price behavior. Broader Context and Implications While the multiplier concept doesn’t change XRP’s total supply — which remains capped at 100 billion — it reframes how market participants should interpret liquidity and price discovery. Ripple’s monthly escrow releases , typically capped at 1 billion XRP, also control how much new supply enters circulation, keeping active liquidity relatively tight. The takeaway is clear: XRP’s potential price response is not purely a function of total supply, but of how much XRP is actually tradable. As Claver summarized, “It’s total supply versus available supply. That’s the reason there is a multiplier effect.” The XRP market cap multiplier effect shows how small changes in liquidity can lead to significant price movements. It’s not speculation — it’s a structural feature of how XRP trades in real-world conditions, where limited availability magnifies every dollar of demand that flows into the asset.

Approvals are likely to resume once full SEC operations return; October 2025 is noted as a key month for several pending crypto ETF deadlines. Investors should monitor SEC notices, prospectus amendments, and custody disclosures for staking mechanics, fee schedules, and counterparty arrangements. Frequently Asked Questions Will staking ETFs increase investor access to altcoins? Yes. Staking ETFs aim to broaden access by allowing investors to gain price and yield exposure through regulated vehicles, avoiding direct custody and staking complexities. Product terms will determine yield distribution and fee impact. Can fund assets be invested in non-U.S. ETPs? Yes. Filings state up to 40% of a fund’s assets may be invested in non-U.S. crypto exchange-traded products from issuers referenced in the filings. This may diversify access to European and Canadian markets within a U.S.-listed wrapper. Are staking rewards guaranteed? No. Staking rewards depend on network conditions, validator performance and protocol rules. Rewards can fluctuate and may be subject to penalties such as slashing for misbehavior or downtime. Key Takeaways Regulatory review active : The SEC is reviewing 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETF filings; approval timelines are delayed by a government shutdown. Yield + market exposure : Proposed ETFs combine staking rewards with token price exposure for altcoins like ADA, AVAX and NEAR. Cross-border allocation : Up to 40% non-U.S. ETP allocation may link funds to international issuers while using Cayman subsidiaries for tax and regulatory alignment. Conclusion The SEC’s review of staking crypto ETFs from REX and Osprey could expand regulated yield-bearing access to major altcoins, but approval timing remains uncertain due to the government shutdown.

Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF demand helped spur filings; BTC ETFs hold roughly $150 billion in assets (CoinGlass data). 3X leveraged ETFs by Defiance Investments propose triple-long and inverse crypto and tech exposure; read the filing highlights and risk considerations — learn more now. What are Defiance Investments’ proposed 3X leveraged ETFs? Defiance Investments’ prospectus requests 49 new 3X leveraged and inverse ETFs , offering triple daily exposure to crypto firms, token-linked ETFs and select tech names. The filing lists single-stock, ETF and crypto ETP targets and repeatedly warns these funds are suited only for aggressive, short-term traders. How do the proposed 3X leveraged crypto ETFs differ from existing 2X products? Three-times leveraged ETFs aim to deliver approximately 3X the daily return of an underlying asset, versus 2X funds that seek double daily moves. Because leverage compounds daily, 3X funds amplify volatility and path dependency, increasing the chance of significant losses over multi-day holding periods. Regulators and market analysts have expressed caution. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Defiance files for 49 3X leveraged ETFs, including crypto and tech exposures\", \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-03T00:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-03T00:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png\" } }, \"description\": \"Defiance Investments proposed 49 new 3X leveraged and inverse ETFs covering crypto firms, token-tracking ETFs and tech names, with explicit risk disclosures for short-term traders.\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/articles/defiance-49-3x-etfs-prospectus\" }} Why did Defiance target crypto firms and token ETFs with 3X leverage? Defiance targeted crypto firms and token-linked ETFs to meet rising investor demand for direct and derivative exposure to digital assets. The surge in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows — with Bitcoin-related funds commanding sizable assets according to CoinGlass — encouraged issuers to explore leveraged versions despite higher risk. What specific companies and token ETFs are named in the filing? The prospectus lists funds tied to Coinbase, MicroStrategy (Bitcoin treasury exposure), Robinhood, BitMine Immersion (Ethereum treasury exposure), Circle (USDC issuer), Grayscale mini-trust ETFs tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum, and a Solana ETF from Volatility Shares. The filing proposes both 3X long and 3X inverse share classes for many of these exposures.

Recent filings — including Defiance’s — indicate the SEC is receiving applications for higher-leverage products. Market analysts, such as ETF.com senior analyst Sumit Roy, note the regulator may permit more volatile products, but approvals will depend on disclosures, structure and investor-protection considerations. How should investors evaluate proposed 3X leveraged ETFs? Evaluate leverage objectives, daily rebalancing mechanics, expense ratios, underlying liquidity, and prospectus risk disclosures. Compare historical one-day return replication and understand compounding effects for multi-day holdings. These funds are primarily for experienced, short-term traders. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to evaluate a 3X leveraged ETF\", \"description\": \"Steps to assess whether a 3X leveraged ETF aligns with a trader's objectives and risk tolerance.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Read the prospectus\", \"text\": \"Review leverage goal, daily reset rules, and risk warnings contained in the fund's prospectus.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Analyze volatility and liquidity\", \"text\": \"Check historical intraday and daily volatility of the underlying asset and the ETF's trading volume.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Simulate multi-day scenarios\", \"text\": \"Model multi-day returns to understand compounding effects and potential drawdowns for holding periods beyond one day.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Compare costs\", \"text\": \"Compare expense ratios and transaction costs relative to alternative exposure methods.\" } ]} Key Takeaways Defiance filed for 49 3X ETFs : Proposals include crypto firms, token ETFs and tech stocks, with both long and inverse classes. Higher leverage increases risk : 3X daily leverage amplifies volatility and can produce large multi-day divergences from expected returns. Investor due diligence required : Read prospectuses, assess liquidity and model compounding before trading these products. Conclusion The Defiance prospectus signals a push to expand 3X leveraged ETFs across crypto and tech exposures, reflecting issuer interest in meeting aggressive trader demand. 3X leveraged ETFs may arrive if approved, but their complexity and high risk make careful evaluation essential. Monitor regulatory decisions and read fund disclosures before trading. NEW: @Defiance_ETFs has just filed for just shy of 50 3X levered ETFs. Some on single stocks, some on other ETFs, some on crypto ETPs.

        "body": "Blockchain network revenue fell 16% month-over-month in September as reduced crypto volatility lowered demand for high-priority transactions, driving network fees down across major chains such as Ethereum, Solana and Tron. Network revenue fell 16% MoM in September Ethereum fees down 6%, Solana down 11%, Tron fees dropped 37% after a governance fee cut. Volatility fell sharply: ETH -40%, SOL -16%, BTC -26% — reducing arbitrage-driven fee demand. Blockchain network revenue fell 16% in September due to lower crypto volatility; read the full analysis, data, and investor takeaways. Learn how fees and fundamentals changed. Asset manager VanEck attributed the broad decline in blockchain network revenue in September to lower volatility in the crypto markets. What caused the decline in blockchain network revenue in September? Blockchain network revenue declined 16% month-over-month in September primarily because lower crypto volatility reduced traders’ need to pay priority fees, decreasing total fees across major networks. VanEck’s analysis cites reduced arbitrage and fewer high-priority transactions as the main drivers. VanEck reported that overall network revenues across the blockchain ecosystem dropped by 16% month-over-month in September, linked to diminished volatility and lower transaction fee demand. Ethereum network revenue fell by 6% and Solana’s by 11%. The Tron network recorded a 37% reduction in fees, which VanEck attributes to a governance proposal that halved gas fees in August. Most cryptocurrencies experienced reduced volatility in September. Source: VanEck How did volatility changes affect crypto network fees? Reduced volatility curtailed arbitrage and time-sensitive trading that typically pushes users to pay higher fees for faster settlement. Ether (ETH) volatility dropped about 40% in September, SOL volatility fell 16%, and BTC volatility declined 26%, according to VanEck’s figures. Lower volatility means fewer rapid price moves and thus fewer priority transactions, translating directly into lower network revenue and smaller fee pools for validators and miners. Why did Tron lead revenue metrics despite lower fees? Tron remains the top revenue-generating crypto ecosystem, producing roughly $3.6 billion over the last year, according to Token Terminal data cited in market reporting. This leadership stems largely from stablecoin activity — 51% of circulating Tether USDt supply is issued on the Tron network. A comparison of crypto network fees over the last year. Source: Token Terminal By comparison, Ethereum generated about $1 billion in annual revenue despite ETH reaching all-time highs in August and a market capitalization near $539 billion — roughly 16x TRX’s market cap of about $32 billion. Stablecoins continue to expand: the stablecoin market cap crossed $292 billion in October 2025, per RWA.XYZ data, reinforcing Tron’s role in settlement and recurring fee generation. How should investors interpret network revenue and fees? Network revenues and fees are a core metric for assessing blockchain economic activity and protocol health. Monitor fees as a short-term gauge of transaction demand and revenue as a longer-term indicator of platform monetization and product fit. Analysts track fundamentals such as active addresses, transaction value, and fee revenue to evaluate project trajectories and ecosystem resilience. Frequently Asked Questions How large was the month-over-month revenue decline in September? The blockchain ecosystem saw a 16% month-over-month decline in network revenue in September, driven largely by reduced volatility and lower priority-fee transactions. Did any networks buck the trend in September? Tron continued to lead annual revenue generation despite a 37% monthly fee drop, thanks to heavy stablecoin settlement activity and prior fee-structure changes. What role did governance changes play in fee reductions? On Tron, a governance proposal reduced gas fees by over 50% in August, contributing to a 37% drop in network fees in September as reflected in revenue data. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"What caused the decline in blockchain network revenue in September?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Reduced crypto volatility lowered arbitrage and priority-fee demand, leading to a 16% month-over-month decline in blockchain network revenue in September.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Why did Tron still lead revenue metrics?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Tron generated the most annual revenue due to heavy stablecoin settlement activity, with 51% of circulating USDT issued on Tron, supporting recurring fee volume.\" } } ]} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Blockchain network revenue drops in September as volatility falls\", \"description\": \"VanEck reports a 16% month-over-month decline in blockchain network revenue in September driven by reduced crypto volatility and lower transaction fees.\", \"image\": [\"https://en.coinotag.com/images/0199b0f3-c6e7-7260-b34f-183b28f6d0b8\"], \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-04T08:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-04T08:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png\" } }, \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com\" }} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to interpret a drop in blockchain network revenue\", \"description\": \"A brief step-by-step guide for investors to assess causes and implications of falling network fees and revenue.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Check volatility metrics\", \"text\": \"Compare ETH, SOL, and BTC volatility changes to see if lower price swings explain fee reductions.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Review protocol governance changes\", \"text\": \"Identify recent fee-structure proposals, such as Tron’s gas fee cut, which can materially reduce revenue.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Analyze stablecoin flows\", \"text\": \"Assess stablecoin issuance and settlement trends, as stablecoin volume can sustain fee revenue even in low-volatility markets.\" } ]} Key Takeaways Revenue decline: A 16% MoM drop in September shows fees are sensitive to volatility and governance changes. Network leaders: Tron leads annual revenue ($3.6B) due to stablecoin settlement dominance; Ethereum earned ~$1B. Investor action: Monitor volatility, fee policy changes, and stablecoin flows to assess short- and long-term revenue trends. Conclusion September’s 16% fall in blockchain network revenue reflects lower crypto volatility and targeted protocol changes that cut fees. Investors should combine fee analytics with on-chain activity and stablecoin trends to evaluate ecosystem health. Review network fundamentals regularly to inform allocation and risk decisions.",

        "body": "Asset management giant VanEck has published its cryptocurrency market report for September 2025. The report noted that Digital Asset Treasuries (DAT) holdings have reached approximately $135 billion, with institutional investors, in particular, continuing to accumulate and stake ETH. VanEck noted that this creates a dilution risk for investors outside of staking. The report also touched on Ethereum's upcoming Fusaka upgrade in December. This update is expected to reduce Layer-2 rollup costs by increasing blob capacity and improve network efficiency by allowing nodes to perform block validation using probabilistic sampling. According to VanEck's report, 23 of the 35 major tokens closed the month lower. Bitcoin (BTC) rose 5%, while Ethereum (ETH) fell 5%. The overall decline in market volatility has dampened both price action and blockchain revenue, causing stagnation in the sector. According to the report, blockchain revenues fell by 16% month-over-month: Ethereum revenues: -6% Solana revenues: -11% Tron revenues: -37% VanEck stated that the primary reason for this decline was the decrease in market volatility. In September, volatility fell by -40% for ETH, -26% for BTC, and -16% for SOL. While decentralized spot exchange (DEX) volumes remained at August levels of approximately $365 billion, futures volumes increased by 30%. Much of this increase was driven by the token launch of the Aster platform within the Binance ecosystem and incentivized trading pairs.

On average, Bitcoin loses 3% of its value in September, while Ethereum loses 7%. The year 2025 is no exception to this historical trend. *This is not investment advice.

        "body": "XRP investors are on edge following a new update that’s sending ripples through the crypto community. This isn’t about hype or speculation—it’s a data-driven analysis of what could be a defining moment for XRP’s price movement. According to a prominent analyst, this setup might be the very opportunity XRP holders have been waiting for. A Defining Moment for XRP Holders In a video shared on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO sounded the alarm: “XRP holders, this could literally be the moment we have been waiting for here on the channel.” He explained that XRP had been consolidating within a bull flag pattern since mid-July and is now beginning to show “very bullish signs.” Steph emphasized that this pattern could lead to a major breakout in the coming days or weeks if confirmed, saying, “I want you guys to be prepared for this. I want to show you exactly what my game plan is, what my expectations are. Is the momentum bullish? Is there a potential bull trap? What’s the best thing right now?” IF YOU HOLD #XRP I GOT NEWS FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!! (urgent) pic.twitter.com/AkTJkXiv6i — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 3, 2025 The Key Confirmation Level: $3 Daily Close The analyst stressed that confirmation is essential before calling a full breakout: “For me to absolutely call and to confirm this breakout, I would need to see the daily candle of today close above three dollars.” According to Steph, a confirmed daily close above this level would strongly suggest that XRP is “most likely heading a lot higher in the next days and the next weeks.” He maintained a technical target of around $5 , derived from the height of the bull flag’s pole, but cautioned traders to remain realistic. “There are no guarantees on the way up,” he said. “Maybe XRP is not going to go to five dollars—maybe we’re going to stop at four dollars or $4.50. It’s important that you have an exit strategy and that you secure profits on the way up.” Bullish Momentum Confirmed by EMA Ribbons Steph also highlighted a significant technical signal—the EMA ribbons on the daily chart. He noted that XRP is “right now actually breaking above daily ribbons, which is a strong sign and shows a lot of bullish momentum, a lot of buying pressure going on.” Historically, when XRP breaks above these ribbons, it often indicates the start of a larger upward move, especially if accompanied by increasing volume. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He added that the broader market context supports this potential surge. “Historically, October and November tend to be very bullish for crypto and for XRP,” he explained. “I think Q4—the next few days and the next few weeks—could be very bullish for XRP . But once again, for absolute confirmation, wait for the daily candle of today to close above three dollars.” Market Context and Outlook As of now, XRP trades just below the critical $3 threshold, consolidating after several attempts to break higher. Analysts widely agree that this level represents a major resistance zone. A confirmed breakout above it could open the door to a sustained rally toward $4–$5, while rejection might lead to renewed consolidation or a temporary pullback. For long-term investors, Steph’s message serves as both encouragement and caution. The current technical setup appears promising, but as he reminded his audience, “There are no guarantees on the way up.” Ultimately, the coming days will determine whether XRP confirms its long-awaited breakout. Traders and holders alike are watching the charts closely—because in crypto, decisive moments often arrive without warning, and being prepared can make all the difference.

        "body": "Meme coins have caught the eye of the crypto world, and two stand out: Dogecoin and PEPE. Investors are curious whether these quirky coins can trigger a new wave of excitement in the market. Could these underdogs lead to a fresh rally? Explore the potential growth drivers and market sentiment in the full article. Dogecoin on the Rise: Is a Surge Around the Corner? Source: tradingview Dogecoin is currently trading between twenty-two and twenty-six cents. Its recent upward trend has seen a price surge of over 15% this week and nearly 20% for the month. The coin's momentum hints at breaking through the nearest resistance level of about twenty-eight cents. If it continues this path, it might soon challenge the second resistance level of roughly thirty-two cents. This could signal a potential growth of over 25%. With its popularity and community backing, Dogecoin remains a digital currency to watch, as its price movements suggest more potential climbs in the future. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR Pepe (PEPE) Price Watch: What to Expect from this Crypto Adventure Source: tradingview Pepe (PEPE) is showing mixed signals. Its current price range swings between a few thousandths of a cent, landing at around $0.000009. Despite it passing a week with almost a 9% rise, the momentum is cautious. It's below the 10-day moving average but slightly above the 100-day average, which points to stable but slow progress. If Pepe breaks the nearest resistance level, it could see a growth of about 15% from its current spot. However, dropping below support could mean a slide of 20%. With its RSI below 50, Pepe’s current potential leans more towards recovery than rapid growth. Conclusion DOGE and PEPE have both shown potential for growth. DOGE remains popular with a strong community backing. PEPE has recently gained attention due to its memes and social media trends. If interest in meme coins continues, both could see price increases. However, market dynamics always play a big role. Keeping an eye on market trends and investor interest is crucial for predicting future movements of these coins. Just as crucial as crafting a narrative that fits the market, the key ability of Outset PR.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/are-these-the-2-best-cryptos-to-buy-as-trump-backed-thumzup-media-expands-dogecoin-mining-with-2-5m-investment/",
        "body": "Thumzup Media, a Trump-backed company, has announced that it has invested $2.5 million in ramping up Dogecoin mining activities with hundreds of additional ASIC rigs and a significant boost in network hash power. The move has rekindled bullish interest in Dogecoin (DOGE), with some speculating that institutional entry may take its price beyond the $1 mark during the next bull run. That said, though DOGE’s momentum is worth keeping an eye on, more seasoned investors are now turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with much greater upside potential. Now at only $0.035, Mutuum Finance has already emerged as one of 2025’s most formidable DeFi plays thanks to its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield tokenomics, and non-custodial smart contract architecture. Presale Stage 6 is already over 55% sold, with more than 16,750 holders and more than $16.8 million raised, all of which are positive indicators of institutional and whale confidence. Mutuum Finance is the smart, utility-backed choice over meme-driven cryptocurrencies like DOGE. Thumzup Media’s $2.5M Investment Has the Potential to Be a Game-Changer for Dogecoin’s Future Dogecoin (DOGE) is winning back institutional confidence after Thumzup Media, a Trump family-supported business, made a substantial $2.5 million investment. The funding will enable DogeHash Technologies to expand its mining capacity exponentially, with over 4,000 mining rigs operational prior to year-end, one of the most extensive Dogecoin mining networks in the U.S. The addition of 500 new high-performance ASIC miners will expand the hash rate of the network, accelerating transaction speed, boosting security, and building further trust in the system as a whole. Thumzup’s entry, signaled by its recent acquisition of 19 BTC and 7.5 million DOGE and eventual investment of as much as $250 million in digital assets, is an indicator of growing institutional interest and confidence in Dogecoin’s long-term potential. Analysts predict the development to catalyze broader institutional uptake and boost DOGE’s position in mainstream crypto portfolios. But as Dogecoin fundamentals keep growing stronger, increasingly more investors are also investigating Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which could offer even greater upside potential beyond the meme-coin narrative. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Traction Mutuum Finance is generating even more hype and anticipation for its presale, with the platform already raising over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 investors onboard to date. Stage 6 of the project is ongoing, during which MUTM tokens are available for purchase at $0.035 per token. In appreciation of early adopters, Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway promotion, in which 10 users will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. The protocol will have a dynamic floating interest rate mechanism that makes the most efficient use of liquidity. Low interest rate environments and excess liquidity environments encourage borrowing and ecosystem activity and high demand environments and higher interest rates encourage loan repayment and incoming capital flows. Fixed interest models function optimally when liquidity is constant, adjusting organically to overall market forces. Mutuum Finance Advances Development of Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance is going ahead with the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , a key step to enhancing its decentralized finance ecosystem. The first version (V1) of the protocol is expected on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will include functionalities such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. ETH and USDT will be supported for lending, borrowing, and collateral at the time of launch, providing users with a convenient and secure DeFi experience. Lending, borrowing, and liquidation at a profit require efficient asset valuation. To this effect, Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to retrieve live USD and principal crypto asset prices such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform realizes optimum data accuracy by utilizing fallback oracle systems, composite data feeds, and time-weighted averages from decentralized exchanges for quality valuations during the highly volatile and distressed market conditions. Dogecoin (DOGE) or Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Dogecoin’s $2.5M mining incentive shows growing interest, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a far more promising prospect. At $0.035 and with over 55% sold, 16,750+ buyers and $16.8M invested, MUTM’s twin lending ecosystem, real-yield tokenomics, and upcoming DeFi protocol render it a utility-based altcoin with tremendous growth potential, which makes DOGE seem like a less desirable option for serious investors.

        "url": "https://timestabloid.com/eric-trump-i-know-brad-garlinghouse-and-xrp-very-well/",
        "body": "A single podcast moment has sent ripples through both the political and crypto worlds. During a recent appearance on the PBD Podcast, Eric Trump made striking comments about his familiarity with Ripple, XRP, and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. The clip, shared by popular crypto influencer JackTheRippler on X, quickly gained momentum — fueling widespread discussion about the growing intersection between politics and digital finance. The conversation took place during the October 4, 2025, episode of the PBD Podcast, hosted by entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David. When asked how he felt about Dogecoin, XRP, Ripple, and Ethereum, Eric Trump’s candid response caught the attention of the crypto community. “I know them all extremely well. I know Brad very well, and XRP, he’s done a great job,” Trump said. JackTheRippler’s post featuring the clip has since gone viral, with thousands of reposts and comments from the XRP community. Many enthusiasts see Trump’s acknowledgment of Garlinghouse as a symbolic nod to Ripple’s growing relevance in global finance — especially as the company continues to recover from years of legal scrutiny and reposition itself for mainstream adoption. Eric Trump says that he knows Brad Garlinghouse and #XRP very well! pic.twitter.com/EK4bygBRLh — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 4, 2025 A Notable Moment for Ripple and XRP Ripple’s reputation has strengthened considerably in 2025 following the conclusion of its legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple has focused on scaling its payment infrastructure and expanding the reach of RLUSD. In this context, Eric Trump’s praise for Brad Garlinghouse carries additional weight. His words come at a time when institutional interest in blockchain payment systems is accelerating — and when the U.S. political landscape is increasingly open to discussing crypto innovation within regulated frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bridging Politics and Crypto Innovation Eric Trump’s remarks also highlight a broader trend: the mainstreaming of cryptocurrency within political and economic circles. His characterization of Bitcoin as “digital gold” and Ethereum as “financial oil” reflects an informed understanding of their roles within the digital economy. Yet, it was his personal acknowledgment of Brad Garlinghouse and XRP that truly resonated with investors, given Ripple’s established presence in institutional payment settlements. The moment signifies how figures within political leadership are beginning to publicly recognize the companies driving blockchain utility, not just speculative assets. In conclusion, while Eric Trump did not make any investment claims about XRP, his recognition of Brad Garlinghouse and Ripple stands as a noteworthy endorsement from a prominent political figure. The viral clip shared by JackTheRippler underscores how quickly influence, politics, and crypto narratives can converge — sometimes in just a few seconds of conversation. For Ripple and its supporters, those few words from the president’s son may have done more than spark social-media buzz; they reaffirmed that XRP’s name is now part of the mainstream financial dialogue.

        "url": "https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/04/got-1500-this-ethereum-meme-coin-is-on-the-verge-of-a-75x-price-pump/",
        "body": "If you have $1,500 set aside for a high-potential crypto play, there is a fresh name that is catching the eye of early investors. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) built on Ethereum is not just another meme coin. It has already climbed more than 120% from its starting presale price and is currently offering about 36.36% projected gains before its public launch. At the time of writing, LILPEPE is priced at $0.0022 in Stage 13 of its presale, having raised an impressive $26.37 million out of a $28.77 million target. A meme coin with momentum Little Pepe is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about Ethereum meme coins of 2025. The token’s presale has been moving at an incredible pace, with more than 16.15 billion of its 17.25 billion tokens already sold. The presale price recently increased from $0.0021 to $0.0022, reflecting steady demand. This is no small feat considering that Stage 1 investors are already sitting on 120% gains while the presale still has six stages left. The project’s momentum is further boosted by its recent listing on CoinMarketCap and a Certik audit score of 95.49%, which strengthens investor confidence. Being both audited and trackable on a significant platform gives LILPEPE credibility that most meme coins lack. Why investors are watching LILPEPE closely The appeal of Little Pepe goes beyond just hype. It is positioning itself as a Layer 2 meme ecosystem that offers zero trading tax, anti-sniper bot protection, and plans for a meme launchpad and NFT marketplace. These features suggest that it aims to be more than a fleeting trend. Community engagement has been high, with the Team running a $777,000 giveaway and introducing a Mega Giveaway worth over 15 ETH in prizes for top presale buyers from Stage 12 to Stage 17. At a time when crypto markets are searching for the next breakout star after Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, LILPEPE’s strong presale and active rewards are pulling in attention from across the meme coin crowd. How LILPEPE stacks up against the big names As of the time of writing, DOGE trades around $0.12 while SHIB hovers near $0.000018. These meme coins still have strong communities but lack the fresh momentum that drives rapid price surges. Little Pepe has stepped into that gap with a lower entry price and a roadmap that blends meme culture with practical tools. The fact that LILPEPE peaked above PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB in ChatGPT’s memecoin search trends between June and August 2025 hints at rising retail interest. The potential upside For investors entering at Stage 13’s $0.0022 price, the token is expected to launch at $0.0030, offering a near-term 36.36% gain even before its first day of open trading. Early-stage buyers have already seen 120% gains, and the speculative talk of a 75x rally reflects hopes that it can catch a fraction of the market cap of DOGE or SHIB as it gains mainstream attention. Final thoughts If you are looking for a fresh entry into the meme coin market and have $1,500 to spare, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is worth a closer look. It combines meme culture with credible tech and is already rewarding early participants. With the presale selling out fast at the time of writing and still offering projected gains of 36.36% before launch, this could be a rare chance to enter early. The presale is nearing its final stages, and as history has shown with other meme sensations, the early days often present the biggest growth window.

        "body": "REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs are exchange-traded funds that combine price exposure with staking rewards, allowing investors to earn yield on tokens such as ADA, AVAX and NEAR while tracking market performance. The SEC is reviewing 21 such ETF filings amid government shutdown delays. SEC review of 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs underway Funds propose staking exposure to altcoins including ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SUI and others. Up to 40% of assets may be allocated to non-U.S. crypto ETPs from issuers like 21Shares and CoinShares. Meta description: staking crypto ETFs under SEC review — 21 REX-Osprey filings offer yield plus price exposure to ADA, AVAX, NEAR; follow regulatory updates on en.coinotag.com. SEC reviews 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs offering yield and price exposure to altcoins like ADA, AVAX, and NEAR amid shutdown delays. SEC reviews 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs as shutdown delays approval and review timelines. New ETFs include staked tokens like ADA, AVAX, and NEAR, offering both yield and price exposure. Up to 40% of ETF assets may be invested in non-U.S. crypto ETPs from 21Shares, CoinShares, and Valour. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing multiple staking-based crypto ETF filings while operating with reduced staff during a government shutdown. REX Shares and Osprey Funds have proposed 21 spot ETFs that combine staking rewards with token price exposure, broadening regulated access to altcoins for institutional and retail investors. What are the REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs under SEC review? REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs are proposed funds that would hold and stake selected proof-of-stake tokens, paying staking rewards to the ETF while tracking token price movements. The filings name tokens such as ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SEI and SUI and outline use of Cayman subsidiaries to meet regulatory and tax requirements. How do these ETFs combine yield and price exposure? The funds are structured to both participate in on-chain staking (generating rewards) and provide market exposure to token price changes. Staking rewards would be retained or distributed according to each fund’s prospectus. Issuers emphasize the ability to deliver staking yield without investors directly managing private keys. Why is the SEC review delayed and what are the regulatory implications? The SEC’s standard review period for ETF filings is approximately 75 days, but reduced staffing from the government shutdown has slowed processing. Past shutdowns, such as in 2018, caused notable approval delays; analysts expect a similar impact now. Any approvals will still need to satisfy custody, custody-provider oversight, and compliance requirements for staking activities. Which tokens and issuers are named in filings? Filings list staked tokens including ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SEI, SUI, TAO and HYPE. The documents reference allocation flexibility allowing up to 40% of fund assets to be invested in non-U.S. exchange-traded products from issuers named in plain text: 21Shares, CoinShares and Valour. Issuers plan Cayman Islands feeder structures to preserve regulated investment company status under U.S. tax rules. How might investor exposure differ compared to existing spot ETFs? Staking crypto ETFs differ from spot ETFs by adding a yield component from protocol-level staking. Investors gain passive yield (subject to slashing and validator performance) in addition to price appreciation or depreciation. The funds aim to reduce operational friction for institutional investors while preserving tradability on U.S. exchanges. Summary comparison of proposed ETFs (example allocation) ETF Primary Token Staking Enabled Potential Non‑U.S. Allocation Target Investor REX-Osprey ADA Staked ETF ADA Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional REX-Osprey AVAX Staked ETF AVAX Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional REX-Osprey NEAR Staked ETF NEAR Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional When could decisions resume and what should investors watch? Approvals are likely to resume once full SEC operations return; October 2025 is noted as a key month for several pending crypto ETF deadlines. Investors should monitor SEC notices, prospectus amendments, and custody disclosures for staking mechanics, fee schedules, and counterparty arrangements. Frequently Asked Questions Will staking ETFs increase investor access to altcoins? Yes. Staking ETFs aim to broaden access by allowing investors to gain price and yield exposure through regulated vehicles, avoiding direct custody and staking complexities. Product terms will determine yield distribution and fee impact. Can fund assets be invested in non-U.S. ETPs? Yes. Filings state up to 40% of a fund’s assets may be invested in non-U.S. crypto exchange-traded products from issuers referenced in the filings. This may diversify access to European and Canadian markets within a U.S.-listed wrapper. Are staking rewards guaranteed? No. Staking rewards depend on network conditions, validator performance and protocol rules. Rewards can fluctuate and may be subject to penalties such as slashing for misbehavior or downtime. Key Takeaways Regulatory review active : The SEC is reviewing 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETF filings; approval timelines are delayed by a government shutdown. Yield + market exposure : Proposed ETFs combine staking rewards with token price exposure for altcoins like ADA, AVAX and NEAR. Cross-border allocation : Up to 40% non-U.S. ETP allocation may link funds to international issuers while using Cayman subsidiaries for tax and regulatory alignment.

Global leaders warn as tech giants drive valuations beyond fundamentals 🇺🇸🇺🇸 Over 50% of the US market cap is now pure Tech. Defensives have collapsed to under 15%. This isn’t diversification – it’s a Tech Empire 🇺🇸🇺🇸 $tsla $nvda $google $appl #Bitcoin $qqq pic.twitter.com/taa4SxxSME — Hod | Code2Capital (@HodTzdaka) October 3, 2025 David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, warned on Friday at Italian Tech Week in Turin, that an AI investment frenzy may be overdone and that stock markets are due for a “drawdown.” Solomon said major US stock indexes have notched record high after record high this year on the promise of artificial intelligence. He argued that there’s a good chance that not all of those investments will deliver big returns. He noted that the internet craze of the late 1990s and early 2000s drew a frenzy of investment in tech companies at the time. Solomon reminded the crowd that the internet craze was followed by a dramatic collapse, which is commonly known as the “dot-com bubble”. “I wouldn’t be surprised if in the next 12 to 24 months, we see a drawdown with respect to equity markets.” David Solomon , Goldman Sachs CEO Jeff Bezos referred to the AI investment wave as an “industrial bubble.” He also emphasized that innovation stemming from such AI investment cycles can still yield long-term advantages. According to Bezos, the market is seeking the next big breakthrough, reminiscent of the dynamics of previous bubbles. He added that the previous bubble dynamic is why many small AI ventures with weak foundations receive investment. On October 3, Dario Perkins, TS Lombard’s Managing Director of Global Macro Research, raised an alarm when he noticed that big tech companies were increasingly using off-balance-sheet loans and special purpose entities (SPVs) to finance AI equipment. According to Perkins, this is a “recognition that this is getting out of hand.” Perkins emphasized that the real leverage and risk exposure of businesses like Meta, which has requested $29 billion in private finance for the expansion of its AI data centre, are concealed by such borrowing techniques.

        "body": "Markets have a way of testing conviction before rewarding it. For XRP holders, that moment of quiet before the storm feels closer than ever. After months of sideways consolidation and growing impatience, many analysts now believe XRP is positioning itself for a powerful move — one that could redefine its market trajectory when it finally unfolds. The Setup: Pattern and Price Renowned market observer The Crypto Philosopher recently shared a striking technical comparison between XRP’s current structure and Amazon’s chart from the early 2000s. In the video, XRP’s weekly chart is overlaid with Amazon’s long-term base that preceded its historic 14x rally from $5 to $70. The resemblance, he argues, is no coincidence. A cup-and-handle pattern is emerging in XRP’s chart, a classic bullish setup that typically precedes a significant upward move. According to The Crypto Philosopher, XRP’s current support sits firmly around $2.70, with a critical breakout level near $3.02. A confirmed move above this resistance, especially with increasing trading volume, could ignite a parabolic run — mirroring the way Amazon’s breakout unleashed years of compounding gains. Xrp is on the brink of its parabolic run It’ll happen when you least expect it Just keep waiting pic.twitter.com/laTpiG5nzE — The Crypto Philosopher (@TheCryptoP73649) October 2, 2025 The Amazon Analogy and Its Implications The comparison to Amazon is notable because it suggests XRP is following a similar pattern of accumulation before explosive growth. Just as Amazon built a foundation for years after the dot-com crash, XRP has been laying groundwork despite market doubts and regulatory challenges. While parallels between equities and digital assets should be drawn with caution, the core logic remains: strong fundamentals, persistent development, and an extended consolidation phase can set the stage for substantial upward revaluation. In XRP’s case, the alignment of technical structure, liquidity positioning, and renewed investor sentiment strengthens the bullish argument. The Expected Timeline If the pattern continues to unfold as projected, XRP could be entering the final stretch of its handle formation, a period that typically lasts from several days to a few weeks before a breakout confirmation. Analysts suggest that a decisive close above $3.02 would mark the official start of the next leg up. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From there, momentum could accelerate rapidly, driven by institutional inflows, renewed market confidence, and increased adoption of Ripple’s technologies in real-world payments and tokenization. However, timing remains fluid. True parabolic runs rarely announce themselves in advance. As The Crypto Philosopher aptly noted, “It’ll happen when you least expect it.” Risks and Confirmation Signals Despite the bullish outlook, traders are urged to remain disciplined. False breakouts can occur, especially in a volatile market. To confirm the trend, analysts suggest looking for three key indicators: sustained volume growth, successful retests of new support levels, and overall crypto market strength driven by Bitcoin. In summary, XRP’s technical setup is nearing a crucial inflection point. If price and volume converge as anticipated, the conditions for a parabolic surge could soon align — turning patience into payoff for long-term believers. Yet, as every seasoned trader knows, conviction must be matched with caution, because even the most promising charts demand validation before the real run begins.

        "body": "Asset management giant VanEck has published its cryptocurrency market report for September 2025. The report noted that Digital Asset Treasuries (DAT) holdings have reached approximately $135 billion, with institutional investors, in particular, continuing to accumulate and stake ETH. VanEck noted that this creates a dilution risk for investors outside of staking. The report also touched on Ethereum's upcoming Fusaka upgrade in December. This update is expected to reduce Layer-2 rollup costs by increasing blob capacity and improve network efficiency by allowing nodes to perform block validation using probabilistic sampling. According to VanEck's report, 23 of the 35 major tokens closed the month lower. Bitcoin (BTC) rose 5%, while Ethereum (ETH) fell 5%. The overall decline in market volatility has dampened both price action and blockchain revenue, causing stagnation in the sector. According to the report, blockchain revenues fell by 16% month-over-month: Ethereum revenues: -6% Solana revenues: -11% Tron revenues: -37% VanEck stated that the primary reason for this decline was the decrease in market volatility. In September, volatility fell by -40% for ETH, -26% for BTC, and -16% for SOL. While decentralized spot exchange (DEX) volumes remained at August levels of approximately $365 billion, futures volumes increased by 30%. Much of this increase was driven by the token launch of the Aster platform within the Binance ecosystem and incentivized trading pairs.

Top performing tokens in September: Mantle (MNT): +53% Avalanche (AVAX): +24% Binance Coin (BNB): +16% The weakest performers are: Polygon (POL): -19% Arbitrum (ARB): -17% Toncoin (TON): -14% VanEck noted that since 2016, September has generally been marked by negative returns. On average, Bitcoin loses 3% of its value in September, while Ethereum loses 7%. The year 2025 is no exception to this historical trend. *This is not investment advice.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/",
        "body": "Key Takeaways: Our Ordinals price prediction anticipates a high of $29.81 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $8 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $8.32 Market cap $174.77M 24-hour trading volume $38.73M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2024 24-hour high $8.95 24-hour low $8.18 Ordi price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 8.87% 50-day SMA $9.05 200-day SMA $9.34 Sentiment Bearish Green days 16/30 (53%) Fear and Greed Index 71 (Greed) Ordi price analysis On the day of writing (October 4), ORDI’s price dropped by 5.51% in 24 hours and 0.11% in the last seven days. Its trading volume dropped by 17.16% showing less trader conviction in the market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades along the Williams alligator trendlines, signaling an uneventful market as the price bounced off support levels ($7.70 Fibonacci midpoint) and key moving averages. The coin has registered negative momentum in the last 7 days. The MACD and signal lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, signaling a bear market. At the same time, the relative strength index is in neutral territory at 44.51. It is oversold when the RSI falls below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI is moving sideways at the $8.39 mark with MACD confirmation (-0.029). The William Alligator trendlines show falling volatility. ORDI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 8.69 SELL SMA 5 8.40 SELL SMA 10 8.46 SELL SMA 21 9.09 SELL SMA 50 9.05 SELL SMA 100 9.17 SELL SMA 200 9.34 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 8.78 SELL EMA 5 8.85 SELL EMA 10 8.91 SELL EMA 21 9.05 SELL EMA 50 9.17 SELL EMA 100 9.38 SELL EMA 200 11.87 SELL What to expect from ORDI price analysis next? ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. Over the short term, ORDI remains correlated with Bitcoin, which is just below $122,000. The charts show it will continue downwards but with less volatility. Why is ORDI down? ORDI’s drop reflects technical triggers, Bitcoin-driven risk aversion, and technical overextension. Its status as a “Bitcoin beta” leaves it exposed during dominance rallies, while thin liquidity magnifies moves. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10. In October, it traded above the $8 mark.",

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-high-can-ethereum-eth-go-this-uptober-chatgpt-breaks-it-down-and-names-a-cheaper-must-buy-crypto-for-2025/",
        "body": "The Uptober month is already living up to its name, with Ethereum (ETH) returning to the limelight as specialists foresee a possible breakout higher than $5,000, and as high as $5,500. More institutional inflows, optimism regarding the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, and higher Layer-2 adoption are all helping to create bullish momentum for the world’s second-largest altcoin. But while ETH’s potential upside remains strong, investors are becoming more interested in a much more high-upside play, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with far greater growth potential at a fraction of the expense. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance has been one of the most popular DeFi projects in 2025 with its twin lending infrastructure, real-yield mechanics, and non-custodial smart contracts tackling critical inefficiencies of decentralized finance. With Stage 6 of its presale over 55% sold out, 16,750+ holders, and over $16.8 million raised, MUTM could outshine ETH in the next run. Ethereum (ETH) Positions Itself for a Strong Uptober Rally Ethereum (ETH) is positioning itself for a potential explosive rally in October 2025, with prices keeping their strength around $4,300 after a steep bounce above $4,000. October, which is known as “Uptober” among traders, historically comes with average returns of nearly 5%, and this time the setup looks even stronger. Institutional demand is increasing as ETH investment funds attract hundreds of millions of inflows, with big players such as BlackRock ongoing in developing its network. At the same time, 30% of the ETH supply is now staked, locking up coins and removing circulating supply from the network, as deflationary token burns further tighten market dynamics. With exhausted exchange reserves, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the bullish BTC trend, and greater crypto euphoria around key U.S. events, analysts say that a breakout above $5,000 is eminently within the realm of possibility. But although ETH displays dazzling upside, the vast majority of investors seeking greater growth potential are starting to eye Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for out-of-proportion returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge as Investor Frenzy Hits All-Time High Mutuum Finance has been providing early adopters with the special opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a lower cost before the project is officially launched. Phase 6 tokens available at $0.035 have been extremely sought after, presale already reaching over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 owners. The figures say volumes of active market enthusiasm and increasing faith in the future of the long-term business. Besides locking down the platform and engaging with community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program with an official $50,000 USDT bug bounty pool. The program invites white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to report codebase vulnerabilities with rewards paid out depending on severity. This ensures that even the minor problems are addressed as quickly as possible and general platform security is high. Mutuum Finance to Roll Out New DeFi Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has announced the upcoming release of its own lending and borrowing protocol , a giant leap towards decentralized finance. The V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have the fundamental components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Since ETH and USDT are supported from the start for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing, the platform aims to offer a stable and scalable foundation for users of DeFi. To access recent and real-time prices, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles along with high-cap token feeds like USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references are provided, which allow multi-layered functionality to supply robust and secure price data in the face of ultra-abnormal market chaos. Ethereum’s “Uptober” rally may propel ETH to over $5,000, yet its potential is capped compared to the early-stage possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at only $0.035 is already more than 55% sold in phase 6 with $16.8M raised, presents much greater growth potential. Its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield structure, and robust presale traction make MUTM the top DeFi altcoin for investors seeking disproportionate 2025 returns.

Bitcoin’s increasing institutional adoption and improving regulatory clarity create a favorable environment for mining operations. Additionally, the upcoming halving cycles historically correlate with significant price appreciation, potentially amplifying mining returns. Professional mining services allow you to participate in this growth without the technical complexities. As energy costs rise globally, individual mining becomes increasingly impractical, while professional operations benefit from economies of scale and renewable energy sources. This approach ensures sustainable and profitable operations that individual miners simply cannot match. The crypto market’s maturation also means more sophisticated investors are looking for reliable passive income streams. Mining provides this opportunity without the volatility of trading or the complexity of DeFi protocols.

        "body": "Meme coins have caught the eye of the crypto world, and two stand out: Dogecoin and PEPE. Investors are curious whether these quirky coins can trigger a new wave of excitement in the market. Could these underdogs lead to a fresh rally? Explore the potential growth drivers and market sentiment in the full article. Dogecoin on the Rise: Is a Surge Around the Corner? Source: tradingview Dogecoin is currently trading between twenty-two and twenty-six cents. Its recent upward trend has seen a price surge of over 15% this week and nearly 20% for the month. The coin's momentum hints at breaking through the nearest resistance level of about twenty-eight cents. If it continues this path, it might soon challenge the second resistance level of roughly thirty-two cents. This could signal a potential growth of over 25%. With its popularity and community backing, Dogecoin remains a digital currency to watch, as its price movements suggest more potential climbs in the future. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR Pepe (PEPE) Price Watch: What to Expect from this Crypto Adventure Source: tradingview Pepe (PEPE) is showing mixed signals. Its current price range swings between a few thousandths of a cent, landing at around $0.000009. Despite it passing a week with almost a 9% rise, the momentum is cautious. It's below the 10-day moving average but slightly above the 100-day average, which points to stable but slow progress. If Pepe breaks the nearest resistance level, it could see a growth of about 15% from its current spot. However, dropping below support could mean a slide of 20%. With its RSI below 50, Pepe’s current potential leans more towards recovery than rapid growth. Conclusion DOGE and PEPE have both shown potential for growth. DOGE remains popular with a strong community backing. PEPE has recently gained attention due to its memes and social media trends. If interest in meme coins continues, both could see price increases. However, market dynamics always play a big role. Keeping an eye on market trends and investor interest is crucial for predicting future movements of these coins. Just as crucial as crafting a narrative that fits the market, the key ability of Outset PR.

        "url": "https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-ive-got-urgent-news-for-you/",
        "body": "XRP investors are on edge following a new update that’s sending ripples through the crypto community. This isn’t about hype or speculation—it’s a data-driven analysis of what could be a defining moment for XRP’s price movement. According to a prominent analyst, this setup might be the very opportunity XRP holders have been waiting for. A Defining Moment for XRP Holders In a video shared on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO sounded the alarm: “XRP holders, this could literally be the moment we have been waiting for here on the channel.” He explained that XRP had been consolidating within a bull flag pattern since mid-July and is now beginning to show “very bullish signs.” Steph emphasized that this pattern could lead to a major breakout in the coming days or weeks if confirmed, saying, “I want you guys to be prepared for this. I want to show you exactly what my game plan is, what my expectations are. Is the momentum bullish? Is there a potential bull trap? What’s the best thing right now?” IF YOU HOLD #XRP I GOT NEWS FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!! (urgent) pic.twitter.com/AkTJkXiv6i — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 3, 2025 The Key Confirmation Level: $3 Daily Close The analyst stressed that confirmation is essential before calling a full breakout: “For me to absolutely call and to confirm this breakout, I would need to see the daily candle of today close above three dollars.” According to Steph, a confirmed daily close above this level would strongly suggest that XRP is “most likely heading a lot higher in the next days and the next weeks.” He maintained a technical target of around $5 , derived from the height of the bull flag’s pole, but cautioned traders to remain realistic. “There are no guarantees on the way up,” he said. “Maybe XRP is not going to go to five dollars—maybe we’re going to stop at four dollars or $4.50. It’s important that you have an exit strategy and that you secure profits on the way up.” Bullish Momentum Confirmed by EMA Ribbons Steph also highlighted a significant technical signal—the EMA ribbons on the daily chart. He noted that XRP is “right now actually breaking above daily ribbons, which is a strong sign and shows a lot of bullish momentum, a lot of buying pressure going on.” Historically, when XRP breaks above these ribbons, it often indicates the start of a larger upward move, especially if accompanied by increasing volume. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He added that the broader market context supports this potential surge. “Historically, October and November tend to be very bullish for crypto and for XRP,” he explained. “I think Q4—the next few days and the next few weeks—could be very bullish for XRP . But once again, for absolute confirmation, wait for the daily candle of today to close above three dollars.” Market Context and Outlook As of now, XRP trades just below the critical $3 threshold, consolidating after several attempts to break higher. Analysts widely agree that this level represents a major resistance zone. A confirmed breakout above it could open the door to a sustained rally toward $4–$5, while rejection might lead to renewed consolidation or a temporary pullback. For long-term investors, Steph’s message serves as both encouragement and caution. The current technical setup appears promising, but as he reminded his audience, “There are no guarantees on the way up.” Ultimately, the coming days will determine whether XRP confirms its long-awaited breakout. Traders and holders alike are watching the charts closely—because in crypto, decisive moments often arrive without warning, and being prepared can make all the difference.

        "body": "Cardano (ADA) continues to capture attention as it edges closer to a crucial resistance level. With recent price gains and steady market momentum, many are wondering if ADA can finally break through the barrier and push beyond the dollar mark. This article looks at the key indicators shaping ADA’s next move—and also highlights how Outset PR applies data-driven clarity to help crypto projects, much like ADA itself, position for lasting growth in a competitive environment. Cardano on the Rise: Potential Growth Amidst Recent Gains Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) is on an upward swing, trading between about 75 to 88 cents. In the past week alone, its price has jumped over 12%. Heading towards the 95-cent resistance mark, Cardano shows promise. If it breaks this barrier, it could target a rise beyond one dollar, which implies a sharp climb. Over the last six months, Cardano has seen a growth of over 31%. Key support at around 69 cents could act as a cushion if prices dip. With a relative strength index near 50, Cardano seems balanced between overbought and oversold, suggesting room for potential further upward movement.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/",
        "body": "Key Takeaways: Our Ordinals price prediction anticipates a high of $29.81 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $8 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $8.32 Market cap $174.77M 24-hour trading volume $38.73M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2024 24-hour high $8.95 24-hour low $8.18 Ordi price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 8.87% 50-day SMA $9.05 200-day SMA $9.34 Sentiment Bearish Green days 16/30 (53%) Fear and Greed Index 71 (Greed) Ordi price analysis On the day of writing (October 4), ORDI’s price dropped by 5.51% in 24 hours and 0.11% in the last seven days. Its trading volume dropped by 17.16% showing less trader conviction in the market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades along the Williams alligator trendlines, signaling an uneventful market as the price bounced off support levels ($7.70 Fibonacci midpoint) and key moving averages. The coin has registered negative momentum in the last 7 days. The MACD and signal lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, signaling a bear market. At the same time, the relative strength index is in neutral territory at 44.51. It is oversold when the RSI falls below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI is moving sideways at the $8.39 mark with MACD confirmation (-0.029). The William Alligator trendlines show falling volatility. ORDI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 8.69 SELL SMA 5 8.40 SELL SMA 10 8.46 SELL SMA 21 9.09 SELL SMA 50 9.05 SELL SMA 100 9.17 SELL SMA 200 9.34 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 8.78 SELL EMA 5 8.85 SELL EMA 10 8.91 SELL EMA 21 9.05 SELL EMA 50 9.17 SELL EMA 100 9.38 SELL EMA 200 11.87 SELL What to expect from ORDI price analysis next? ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. Over the short term, ORDI remains correlated with Bitcoin, which is just below $122,000. The charts show it will continue downwards but with less volatility. Why is ORDI down? ORDI’s drop reflects technical triggers, Bitcoin-driven risk aversion, and technical overextension. Its status as a “Bitcoin beta” leaves it exposed during dominance rallies, while thin liquidity magnifies moves. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come. Ordinals price prediction October 2025 The Ordinals forecast for October is a maximum price of $9.40 and a minimum price of $7.25. The average trading price will be $8.94.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10. In October, it traded above the $8 mark.",

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-high-can-ethereum-eth-go-this-uptober-chatgpt-breaks-it-down-and-names-a-cheaper-must-buy-crypto-for-2025/",
        "body": "The Uptober month is already living up to its name, with Ethereum (ETH) returning to the limelight as specialists foresee a possible breakout higher than $5,000, and as high as $5,500. More institutional inflows, optimism regarding the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, and higher Layer-2 adoption are all helping to create bullish momentum for the world’s second-largest altcoin. But while ETH’s potential upside remains strong, investors are becoming more interested in a much more high-upside play, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with far greater growth potential at a fraction of the expense. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance has been one of the most popular DeFi projects in 2025 with its twin lending infrastructure, real-yield mechanics, and non-custodial smart contracts tackling critical inefficiencies of decentralized finance. With Stage 6 of its presale over 55% sold out, 16,750+ holders, and over $16.8 million raised, MUTM could outshine ETH in the next run. Ethereum (ETH) Positions Itself for a Strong Uptober Rally Ethereum (ETH) is positioning itself for a potential explosive rally in October 2025, with prices keeping their strength around $4,300 after a steep bounce above $4,000. October, which is known as “Uptober” among traders, historically comes with average returns of nearly 5%, and this time the setup looks even stronger. Institutional demand is increasing as ETH investment funds attract hundreds of millions of inflows, with big players such as BlackRock ongoing in developing its network. At the same time, 30% of the ETH supply is now staked, locking up coins and removing circulating supply from the network, as deflationary token burns further tighten market dynamics. With exhausted exchange reserves, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the bullish BTC trend, and greater crypto euphoria around key U.S. events, analysts say that a breakout above $5,000 is eminently within the realm of possibility. But although ETH displays dazzling upside, the vast majority of investors seeking greater growth potential are starting to eye Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for out-of-proportion returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge as Investor Frenzy Hits All-Time High Mutuum Finance has been providing early adopters with the special opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a lower cost before the project is officially launched. Phase 6 tokens available at $0.035 have been extremely sought after, presale already reaching over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 owners. The figures say volumes of active market enthusiasm and increasing faith in the future of the long-term business. Besides locking down the platform and engaging with community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program with an official $50,000 USDT bug bounty pool. The program invites white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to report codebase vulnerabilities with rewards paid out depending on severity. This ensures that even the minor problems are addressed as quickly as possible and general platform security is high. Mutuum Finance to Roll Out New DeFi Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has announced the upcoming release of its own lending and borrowing protocol , a giant leap towards decentralized finance. The V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have the fundamental components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Since ETH and USDT are supported from the start for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing, the platform aims to offer a stable and scalable foundation for users of DeFi. To access recent and real-time prices, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles along with high-cap token feeds like USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references are provided, which allow multi-layered functionality to supply robust and secure price data in the face of ultra-abnormal market chaos. Ethereum’s “Uptober” rally may propel ETH to over $5,000, yet its potential is capped compared to the early-stage possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at only $0.035 is already more than 55% sold in phase 6 with $16.8M raised, presents much greater growth potential. Its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield structure, and robust presale traction make MUTM the top DeFi altcoin for investors seeking disproportionate 2025 returns.

        "body": "REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs are exchange-traded funds that combine price exposure with staking rewards, allowing investors to earn yield on tokens such as ADA, AVAX and NEAR while tracking market performance. The SEC is reviewing 21 such ETF filings amid government shutdown delays. SEC review of 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs underway Funds propose staking exposure to altcoins including ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SUI and others. Up to 40% of assets may be allocated to non-U.S. crypto ETPs from issuers like 21Shares and CoinShares. Meta description: staking crypto ETFs under SEC review — 21 REX-Osprey filings offer yield plus price exposure to ADA, AVAX, NEAR; follow regulatory updates on en.coinotag.com. SEC reviews 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs offering yield and price exposure to altcoins like ADA, AVAX, and NEAR amid shutdown delays. SEC reviews 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs as shutdown delays approval and review timelines. New ETFs include staked tokens like ADA, AVAX, and NEAR, offering both yield and price exposure. Up to 40% of ETF assets may be invested in non-U.S. crypto ETPs from 21Shares, CoinShares, and Valour. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing multiple staking-based crypto ETF filings while operating with reduced staff during a government shutdown. REX Shares and Osprey Funds have proposed 21 spot ETFs that combine staking rewards with token price exposure, broadening regulated access to altcoins for institutional and retail investors. What are the REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs under SEC review? REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs are proposed funds that would hold and stake selected proof-of-stake tokens, paying staking rewards to the ETF while tracking token price movements. The filings name tokens such as ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SEI and SUI and outline use of Cayman subsidiaries to meet regulatory and tax requirements. How do these ETFs combine yield and price exposure? The funds are structured to both participate in on-chain staking (generating rewards) and provide market exposure to token price changes. Staking rewards would be retained or distributed according to each fund’s prospectus. Issuers emphasize the ability to deliver staking yield without investors directly managing private keys. Why is the SEC review delayed and what are the regulatory implications? The SEC’s standard review period for ETF filings is approximately 75 days, but reduced staffing from the government shutdown has slowed processing. Past shutdowns, such as in 2018, caused notable approval delays; analysts expect a similar impact now. Any approvals will still need to satisfy custody, custody-provider oversight, and compliance requirements for staking activities. Which tokens and issuers are named in filings? Filings list staked tokens including ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SEI, SUI, TAO and HYPE. The documents reference allocation flexibility allowing up to 40% of fund assets to be invested in non-U.S. exchange-traded products from issuers named in plain text: 21Shares, CoinShares and Valour. Issuers plan Cayman Islands feeder structures to preserve regulated investment company status under U.S. tax rules. How might investor exposure differ compared to existing spot ETFs? Staking crypto ETFs differ from spot ETFs by adding a yield component from protocol-level staking. Investors gain passive yield (subject to slashing and validator performance) in addition to price appreciation or depreciation. The funds aim to reduce operational friction for institutional investors while preserving tradability on U.S. exchanges. Summary comparison of proposed ETFs (example allocation) ETF Primary Token Staking Enabled Potential Non‑U.S. Allocation Target Investor REX-Osprey ADA Staked ETF ADA Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional REX-Osprey AVAX Staked ETF AVAX Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional REX-Osprey NEAR Staked ETF NEAR Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional When could decisions resume and what should investors watch? Approvals are likely to resume once full SEC operations return; October 2025 is noted as a key month for several pending crypto ETF deadlines. Investors should monitor SEC notices, prospectus amendments, and custody disclosures for staking mechanics, fee schedules, and counterparty arrangements. Frequently Asked Questions Will staking ETFs increase investor access to altcoins? Yes. Staking ETFs aim to broaden access by allowing investors to gain price and yield exposure through regulated vehicles, avoiding direct custody and staking complexities. Product terms will determine yield distribution and fee impact. Can fund assets be invested in non-U.S. ETPs? Yes. Filings state up to 40% of a fund’s assets may be invested in non-U.S. crypto exchange-traded products from issuers referenced in the filings. This may diversify access to European and Canadian markets within a U.S.-listed wrapper. Are staking rewards guaranteed? No. Staking rewards depend on network conditions, validator performance and protocol rules. Rewards can fluctuate and may be subject to penalties such as slashing for misbehavior or downtime. Key Takeaways Regulatory review active : The SEC is reviewing 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETF filings; approval timelines are delayed by a government shutdown. Yield + market exposure : Proposed ETFs combine staking rewards with token price exposure for altcoins like ADA, AVAX and NEAR.

        "body": "Meme coins have caught the eye of the crypto world, and two stand out: Dogecoin and PEPE. Investors are curious whether these quirky coins can trigger a new wave of excitement in the market. Could these underdogs lead to a fresh rally? Explore the potential growth drivers and market sentiment in the full article. Dogecoin on the Rise: Is a Surge Around the Corner? Source: tradingview Dogecoin is currently trading between twenty-two and twenty-six cents. Its recent upward trend has seen a price surge of over 15% this week and nearly 20% for the month. The coin's momentum hints at breaking through the nearest resistance level of about twenty-eight cents. If it continues this path, it might soon challenge the second resistance level of roughly thirty-two cents. This could signal a potential growth of over 25%. With its popularity and community backing, Dogecoin remains a digital currency to watch, as its price movements suggest more potential climbs in the future. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR Pepe (PEPE) Price Watch: What to Expect from this Crypto Adventure Source: tradingview Pepe (PEPE) is showing mixed signals. Its current price range swings between a few thousandths of a cent, landing at around $0.000009. Despite it passing a week with almost a 9% rise, the momentum is cautious. It's below the 10-day moving average but slightly above the 100-day average, which points to stable but slow progress. If Pepe breaks the nearest resistance level, it could see a growth of about 15% from its current spot. However, dropping below support could mean a slide of 20%. With its RSI below 50, Pepe’s current potential leans more towards recovery than rapid growth. Conclusion DOGE and PEPE have both shown potential for growth. DOGE remains popular with a strong community backing. PEPE has recently gained attention due to its memes and social media trends. If interest in meme coins continues, both could see price increases. However, market dynamics always play a big role. Keeping an eye on market trends and investor interest is crucial for predicting future movements of these coins. Just as crucial as crafting a narrative that fits the market, the key ability of Outset PR.

        "body": "The UFC has grown into one of the most bet-on sports properties in the world, and mixed martial arts (MMA) continues to attract new fans every season.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-high-can-ethereum-eth-go-this-uptober-chatgpt-breaks-it-down-and-names-a-cheaper-must-buy-crypto-for-2025/",
        "body": "The Uptober month is already living up to its name, with Ethereum (ETH) returning to the limelight as specialists foresee a possible breakout higher than $5,000, and as high as $5,500. More institutional inflows, optimism regarding the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, and higher Layer-2 adoption are all helping to create bullish momentum for the world’s second-largest altcoin. But while ETH’s potential upside remains strong, investors are becoming more interested in a much more high-upside play, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with far greater growth potential at a fraction of the expense. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance has been one of the most popular DeFi projects in 2025 with its twin lending infrastructure, real-yield mechanics, and non-custodial smart contracts tackling critical inefficiencies of decentralized finance. With Stage 6 of its presale over 55% sold out, 16,750+ holders, and over $16.8 million raised, MUTM could outshine ETH in the next run. Ethereum (ETH) Positions Itself for a Strong Uptober Rally Ethereum (ETH) is positioning itself for a potential explosive rally in October 2025, with prices keeping their strength around $4,300 after a steep bounce above $4,000. October, which is known as “Uptober” among traders, historically comes with average returns of nearly 5%, and this time the setup looks even stronger. Institutional demand is increasing as ETH investment funds attract hundreds of millions of inflows, with big players such as BlackRock ongoing in developing its network. At the same time, 30% of the ETH supply is now staked, locking up coins and removing circulating supply from the network, as deflationary token burns further tighten market dynamics. With exhausted exchange reserves, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the bullish BTC trend, and greater crypto euphoria around key U.S. events, analysts say that a breakout above $5,000 is eminently within the realm of possibility. But although ETH displays dazzling upside, the vast majority of investors seeking greater growth potential are starting to eye Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for out-of-proportion returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge as Investor Frenzy Hits All-Time High Mutuum Finance has been providing early adopters with the special opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a lower cost before the project is officially launched. Phase 6 tokens available at $0.035 have been extremely sought after, presale already reaching over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 owners. The figures say volumes of active market enthusiasm and increasing faith in the future of the long-term business. Besides locking down the platform and engaging with community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program with an official $50,000 USDT bug bounty pool. The program invites white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to report codebase vulnerabilities with rewards paid out depending on severity. This ensures that even the minor problems are addressed as quickly as possible and general platform security is high. Mutuum Finance to Roll Out New DeFi Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has announced the upcoming release of its own lending and borrowing protocol , a giant leap towards decentralized finance. The V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have the fundamental components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Since ETH and USDT are supported from the start for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing, the platform aims to offer a stable and scalable foundation for users of DeFi. To access recent and real-time prices, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles along with high-cap token feeds like USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references are provided, which allow multi-layered functionality to supply robust and secure price data in the face of ultra-abnormal market chaos. Ethereum’s “Uptober” rally may propel ETH to over $5,000, yet its potential is capped compared to the early-stage possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at only $0.035 is already more than 55% sold in phase 6 with $16.8M raised, presents much greater growth potential. Its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield structure, and robust presale traction make MUTM the top DeFi altcoin for investors seeking disproportionate 2025 returns.

Bitcoin’s increasing institutional adoption and improving regulatory clarity create a favorable environment for mining operations. Additionally, the upcoming halving cycles historically correlate with significant price appreciation, potentially amplifying mining returns. Professional mining services allow you to participate in this growth without the technical complexities. As energy costs rise globally, individual mining becomes increasingly impractical, while professional operations benefit from economies of scale and renewable energy sources. This approach ensures sustainable and profitable operations that individual miners simply cannot match. The crypto market’s maturation also means more sophisticated investors are looking for reliable passive income streams. Mining provides this opportunity without the volatility of trading or the complexity of DeFi protocols.

        "body": "REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs are exchange-traded funds that combine price exposure with staking rewards, allowing investors to earn yield on tokens such as ADA, AVAX and NEAR while tracking market performance. The SEC is reviewing 21 such ETF filings amid government shutdown delays. SEC review of 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs underway Funds propose staking exposure to altcoins including ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SUI and others. Up to 40% of assets may be allocated to non-U.S. crypto ETPs from issuers like 21Shares and CoinShares. Meta description: staking crypto ETFs under SEC review — 21 REX-Osprey filings offer yield plus price exposure to ADA, AVAX, NEAR; follow regulatory updates on en.coinotag.com. SEC reviews 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs offering yield and price exposure to altcoins like ADA, AVAX, and NEAR amid shutdown delays. SEC reviews 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs as shutdown delays approval and review timelines. New ETFs include staked tokens like ADA, AVAX, and NEAR, offering both yield and price exposure. Up to 40% of ETF assets may be invested in non-U.S. crypto ETPs from 21Shares, CoinShares, and Valour. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing multiple staking-based crypto ETF filings while operating with reduced staff during a government shutdown. REX Shares and Osprey Funds have proposed 21 spot ETFs that combine staking rewards with token price exposure, broadening regulated access to altcoins for institutional and retail investors. What are the REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs under SEC review? REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs are proposed funds that would hold and stake selected proof-of-stake tokens, paying staking rewards to the ETF while tracking token price movements. The filings name tokens such as ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SEI and SUI and outline use of Cayman subsidiaries to meet regulatory and tax requirements. How do these ETFs combine yield and price exposure? The funds are structured to both participate in on-chain staking (generating rewards) and provide market exposure to token price changes. Staking rewards would be retained or distributed according to each fund’s prospectus. Issuers emphasize the ability to deliver staking yield without investors directly managing private keys. Why is the SEC review delayed and what are the regulatory implications? The SEC’s standard review period for ETF filings is approximately 75 days, but reduced staffing from the government shutdown has slowed processing. Past shutdowns, such as in 2018, caused notable approval delays; analysts expect a similar impact now. Any approvals will still need to satisfy custody, custody-provider oversight, and compliance requirements for staking activities. Which tokens and issuers are named in filings? Filings list staked tokens including ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SEI, SUI, TAO and HYPE. The documents reference allocation flexibility allowing up to 40% of fund assets to be invested in non-U.S. exchange-traded products from issuers named in plain text: 21Shares, CoinShares and Valour. Issuers plan Cayman Islands feeder structures to preserve regulated investment company status under U.S. tax rules. How might investor exposure differ compared to existing spot ETFs? Staking crypto ETFs differ from spot ETFs by adding a yield component from protocol-level staking. Investors gain passive yield (subject to slashing and validator performance) in addition to price appreciation or depreciation. The funds aim to reduce operational friction for institutional investors while preserving tradability on U.S. exchanges. Summary comparison of proposed ETFs (example allocation) ETF Primary Token Staking Enabled Potential Non‑U.S. Allocation Target Investor REX-Osprey ADA Staked ETF ADA Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional REX-Osprey AVAX Staked ETF AVAX Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional REX-Osprey NEAR Staked ETF NEAR Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional When could decisions resume and what should investors watch? Approvals are likely to resume once full SEC operations return; October 2025 is noted as a key month for several pending crypto ETF deadlines. Investors should monitor SEC notices, prospectus amendments, and custody disclosures for staking mechanics, fee schedules, and counterparty arrangements. Frequently Asked Questions Will staking ETFs increase investor access to altcoins? Yes. Staking ETFs aim to broaden access by allowing investors to gain price and yield exposure through regulated vehicles, avoiding direct custody and staking complexities. Product terms will determine yield distribution and fee impact. Can fund assets be invested in non-U.S. ETPs? Yes. Filings state up to 40% of a fund’s assets may be invested in non-U.S. crypto exchange-traded products from issuers referenced in the filings. This may diversify access to European and Canadian markets within a U.S.-listed wrapper. Are staking rewards guaranteed? No. Staking rewards depend on network conditions, validator performance and protocol rules. Rewards can fluctuate and may be subject to penalties such as slashing for misbehavior or downtime. Key Takeaways Regulatory review active : The SEC is reviewing 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETF filings; approval timelines are delayed by a government shutdown. Yield + market exposure : Proposed ETFs combine staking rewards with token price exposure for altcoins like ADA, AVAX and NEAR. Cross-border allocation : Up to 40% non-U.S. ETP allocation may link funds to international issuers while using Cayman subsidiaries for tax and regulatory alignment. Conclusion The SEC’s review of staking crypto ETFs from REX and Osprey could expand regulated yield-bearing access to major altcoins, but approval timing remains uncertain due to the government shutdown.

        "body": "Defiance Investments filed a prospectus proposing 49 new 3X leveraged and inverse ETFs, including crypto-focused funds that track Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Robinhood, BitMine Immersion, Circle, Grayscale mini-trusts and a Solana ETF; the filing warns these 3X leveraged ETFs carry high short-term risk for aggressive traders. 49 proposed funds offering 3X long and inverse exposure Proposals include crypto firms, token-tracking ETFs, tech stocks and gold with explicit investor risk warnings. Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF demand helped spur filings; BTC ETFs hold roughly $150 billion in assets (CoinGlass data). 3X leveraged ETFs by Defiance Investments propose triple-long and inverse crypto and tech exposure; read the filing highlights and risk considerations — learn more now. What are Defiance Investments’ proposed 3X leveraged ETFs? Defiance Investments’ prospectus requests 49 new 3X leveraged and inverse ETFs , offering triple daily exposure to crypto firms, token-linked ETFs and select tech names. The filing lists single-stock, ETF and crypto ETP targets and repeatedly warns these funds are suited only for aggressive, short-term traders. How do the proposed 3X leveraged crypto ETFs differ from existing 2X products? Three-times leveraged ETFs aim to deliver approximately 3X the daily return of an underlying asset, versus 2X funds that seek double daily moves. Because leverage compounds daily, 3X funds amplify volatility and path dependency, increasing the chance of significant losses over multi-day holding periods. Regulators and market analysts have expressed caution. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Defiance files for 49 3X leveraged ETFs, including crypto and tech exposures\", \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-03T00:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-03T00:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png\" } }, \"description\": \"Defiance Investments proposed 49 new 3X leveraged and inverse ETFs covering crypto firms, token-tracking ETFs and tech names, with explicit risk disclosures for short-term traders.\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/articles/defiance-49-3x-etfs-prospectus\" }} Why did Defiance target crypto firms and token ETFs with 3X leverage? Defiance targeted crypto firms and token-linked ETFs to meet rising investor demand for direct and derivative exposure to digital assets. The surge in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows — with Bitcoin-related funds commanding sizable assets according to CoinGlass — encouraged issuers to explore leveraged versions despite higher risk. What specific companies and token ETFs are named in the filing? The prospectus lists funds tied to Coinbase, MicroStrategy (Bitcoin treasury exposure), Robinhood, BitMine Immersion (Ethereum treasury exposure), Circle (USDC issuer), Grayscale mini-trust ETFs tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum, and a Solana ETF from Volatility Shares. The filing proposes both 3X long and 3X inverse share classes for many of these exposures.

Recent filings — including Defiance’s — indicate the SEC is receiving applications for higher-leverage products. Market analysts, such as ETF.com senior analyst Sumit Roy, note the regulator may permit more volatile products, but approvals will depend on disclosures, structure and investor-protection considerations. How should investors evaluate proposed 3X leveraged ETFs? Evaluate leverage objectives, daily rebalancing mechanics, expense ratios, underlying liquidity, and prospectus risk disclosures. Compare historical one-day return replication and understand compounding effects for multi-day holdings. These funds are primarily for experienced, short-term traders. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to evaluate a 3X leveraged ETF\", \"description\": \"Steps to assess whether a 3X leveraged ETF aligns with a trader's objectives and risk tolerance.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Read the prospectus\", \"text\": \"Review leverage goal, daily reset rules, and risk warnings contained in the fund's prospectus.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Analyze volatility and liquidity\", \"text\": \"Check historical intraday and daily volatility of the underlying asset and the ETF's trading volume.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Simulate multi-day scenarios\", \"text\": \"Model multi-day returns to understand compounding effects and potential drawdowns for holding periods beyond one day.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Compare costs\", \"text\": \"Compare expense ratios and transaction costs relative to alternative exposure methods.\" } ]} Key Takeaways Defiance filed for 49 3X ETFs : Proposals include crypto firms, token ETFs and tech stocks, with both long and inverse classes. Higher leverage increases risk : 3X daily leverage amplifies volatility and can produce large multi-day divergences from expected returns. Investor due diligence required : Read prospectuses, assess liquidity and model compounding before trading these products. Conclusion The Defiance prospectus signals a push to expand 3X leveraged ETFs across crypto and tech exposures, reflecting issuer interest in meeting aggressive trader demand. 3X leveraged ETFs may arrive if approved, but their complexity and high risk make careful evaluation essential. Monitor regulatory decisions and read fund disclosures before trading. NEW: @Defiance_ETFs has just filed for just shy of 50 3X levered ETFs. Some on single stocks, some on other ETFs, some on crypto ETPs.

        "body": "Blockchain network revenue fell 16% month-over-month in September as reduced crypto volatility lowered demand for high-priority transactions, driving network fees down across major chains such as Ethereum, Solana and Tron. Network revenue fell 16% MoM in September Ethereum fees down 6%, Solana down 11%, Tron fees dropped 37% after a governance fee cut. Volatility fell sharply: ETH -40%, SOL -16%, BTC -26% — reducing arbitrage-driven fee demand. Blockchain network revenue fell 16% in September due to lower crypto volatility; read the full analysis, data, and investor takeaways. Learn how fees and fundamentals changed. Asset manager VanEck attributed the broad decline in blockchain network revenue in September to lower volatility in the crypto markets. What caused the decline in blockchain network revenue in September? Blockchain network revenue declined 16% month-over-month in September primarily because lower crypto volatility reduced traders’ need to pay priority fees, decreasing total fees across major networks. VanEck’s analysis cites reduced arbitrage and fewer high-priority transactions as the main drivers. VanEck reported that overall network revenues across the blockchain ecosystem dropped by 16% month-over-month in September, linked to diminished volatility and lower transaction fee demand. Ethereum network revenue fell by 6% and Solana’s by 11%. The Tron network recorded a 37% reduction in fees, which VanEck attributes to a governance proposal that halved gas fees in August. Most cryptocurrencies experienced reduced volatility in September. Source: VanEck How did volatility changes affect crypto network fees? Reduced volatility curtailed arbitrage and time-sensitive trading that typically pushes users to pay higher fees for faster settlement. Ether (ETH) volatility dropped about 40% in September, SOL volatility fell 16%, and BTC volatility declined 26%, according to VanEck’s figures. Lower volatility means fewer rapid price moves and thus fewer priority transactions, translating directly into lower network revenue and smaller fee pools for validators and miners. Why did Tron lead revenue metrics despite lower fees? Tron remains the top revenue-generating crypto ecosystem, producing roughly $3.6 billion over the last year, according to Token Terminal data cited in market reporting. This leadership stems largely from stablecoin activity — 51% of circulating Tether USDt supply is issued on the Tron network. A comparison of crypto network fees over the last year. Source: Token Terminal By comparison, Ethereum generated about $1 billion in annual revenue despite ETH reaching all-time highs in August and a market capitalization near $539 billion — roughly 16x TRX’s market cap of about $32 billion. Stablecoins continue to expand: the stablecoin market cap crossed $292 billion in October 2025, per RWA.XYZ data, reinforcing Tron’s role in settlement and recurring fee generation. How should investors interpret network revenue and fees? Network revenues and fees are a core metric for assessing blockchain economic activity and protocol health. Monitor fees as a short-term gauge of transaction demand and revenue as a longer-term indicator of platform monetization and product fit. Analysts track fundamentals such as active addresses, transaction value, and fee revenue to evaluate project trajectories and ecosystem resilience. Frequently Asked Questions How large was the month-over-month revenue decline in September? The blockchain ecosystem saw a 16% month-over-month decline in network revenue in September, driven largely by reduced volatility and lower priority-fee transactions. Did any networks buck the trend in September? Tron continued to lead annual revenue generation despite a 37% monthly fee drop, thanks to heavy stablecoin settlement activity and prior fee-structure changes. What role did governance changes play in fee reductions? On Tron, a governance proposal reduced gas fees by over 50% in August, contributing to a 37% drop in network fees in September as reflected in revenue data. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"What caused the decline in blockchain network revenue in September?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Reduced crypto volatility lowered arbitrage and priority-fee demand, leading to a 16% month-over-month decline in blockchain network revenue in September.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Why did Tron still lead revenue metrics?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Tron generated the most annual revenue due to heavy stablecoin settlement activity, with 51% of circulating USDT issued on Tron, supporting recurring fee volume.\" } } ]} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Blockchain network revenue drops in September as volatility falls\", \"description\": \"VanEck reports a 16% month-over-month decline in blockchain network revenue in September driven by reduced crypto volatility and lower transaction fees.\", \"image\": [\"https://en.coinotag.com/images/0199b0f3-c6e7-7260-b34f-183b28f6d0b8\"], \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-04T08:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-04T08:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png\" } }, \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com\" }} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to interpret a drop in blockchain network revenue\", \"description\": \"A brief step-by-step guide for investors to assess causes and implications of falling network fees and revenue.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Check volatility metrics\", \"text\": \"Compare ETH, SOL, and BTC volatility changes to see if lower price swings explain fee reductions.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Review protocol governance changes\", \"text\": \"Identify recent fee-structure proposals, such as Tron’s gas fee cut, which can materially reduce revenue.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Analyze stablecoin flows\", \"text\": \"Assess stablecoin issuance and settlement trends, as stablecoin volume can sustain fee revenue even in low-volatility markets.\" } ]} Key Takeaways Revenue decline: A 16% MoM drop in September shows fees are sensitive to volatility and governance changes. Network leaders: Tron leads annual revenue ($3.6B) due to stablecoin settlement dominance; Ethereum earned ~$1B. Investor action: Monitor volatility, fee policy changes, and stablecoin flows to assess short- and long-term revenue trends. Conclusion September’s 16% fall in blockchain network revenue reflects lower crypto volatility and targeted protocol changes that cut fees. Investors should combine fee analytics with on-chain activity and stablecoin trends to evaluate ecosystem health. Review network fundamentals regularly to inform allocation and risk decisions.",

        "body": "The Uptober month is already living up to its name, with Ethereum (ETH) returning to the limelight as specialists foresee a possible breakout higher than $5,000, and as high as $5,500. More institutional inflows, optimism regarding the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, and higher Layer-2 adoption are all helping to create bullish momentum for the world’s second-largest altcoin. But while ETH’s potential upside remains strong, investors are becoming more interested in a much more high-upside play, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with far greater growth potential at a fraction of the expense. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance has been one of the most popular DeFi projects in 2025 with its twin lending infrastructure, real-yield mechanics, and non-custodial smart contracts tackling critical inefficiencies of decentralized finance. With Stage 6 of its presale over 55% sold out, 16,750+ holders, and over $16.8 million raised, MUTM could outshine ETH in the next run. Ethereum (ETH) Positions Itself for a Strong Uptober Rally Ethereum (ETH) is positioning itself for a potential explosive rally in October 2025, with prices keeping their strength around $4,300 after a steep bounce above $4,000. October, which is known as “Uptober” among traders, historically comes with average returns of nearly 5%, and this time the setup looks even stronger. Institutional demand is increasing as ETH investment funds attract hundreds of millions of inflows, with big players such as BlackRock ongoing in developing its network. At the same time, 30% of the ETH supply is now staked, locking up coins and removing circulating supply from the network, as deflationary token burns further tighten market dynamics. With exhausted exchange reserves, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the bullish BTC trend, and greater crypto euphoria around key U.S. events, analysts say that a breakout above $5,000 is eminently within the realm of possibility. But although ETH displays dazzling upside, the vast majority of investors seeking greater growth potential are starting to eye Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for out-of-proportion returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge as Investor Frenzy Hits All-Time High Mutuum Finance has been providing early adopters with the special opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a lower cost before the project is officially launched. Phase 6 tokens available at $0.035 have been extremely sought after, presale already reaching over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 owners. The figures say volumes of active market enthusiasm and increasing faith in the future of the long-term business. Besides locking down the platform and engaging with community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program with an official $50,000 USDT bug bounty pool. The program invites white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to report codebase vulnerabilities with rewards paid out depending on severity. This ensures that even the minor problems are addressed as quickly as possible and general platform security is high. Mutuum Finance to Roll Out New DeFi Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has announced the upcoming release of its own lending and borrowing protocol , a giant leap towards decentralized finance. The V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have the fundamental components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Since ETH and USDT are supported from the start for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing, the platform aims to offer a stable and scalable foundation for users of DeFi. To access recent and real-time prices, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles along with high-cap token feeds like USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references are provided, which allow multi-layered functionality to supply robust and secure price data in the face of ultra-abnormal market chaos. Ethereum’s “Uptober” rally may propel ETH to over $5,000, yet its potential is capped compared to the early-stage possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at only $0.035 is already more than 55% sold in phase 6 with $16.8M raised, presents much greater growth potential. Its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield structure, and robust presale traction make MUTM the top DeFi altcoin for investors seeking disproportionate 2025 returns.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/are-these-the-2-best-cryptos-to-buy-as-trump-backed-thumzup-media-expands-dogecoin-mining-with-2-5m-investment/",
        "body": "Thumzup Media, a Trump-backed company, has announced that it has invested $2.5 million in ramping up Dogecoin mining activities with hundreds of additional ASIC rigs and a significant boost in network hash power. The move has rekindled bullish interest in Dogecoin (DOGE), with some speculating that institutional entry may take its price beyond the $1 mark during the next bull run. That said, though DOGE’s momentum is worth keeping an eye on, more seasoned investors are now turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with much greater upside potential. Now at only $0.035, Mutuum Finance has already emerged as one of 2025’s most formidable DeFi plays thanks to its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield tokenomics, and non-custodial smart contract architecture. Presale Stage 6 is already over 55% sold, with more than 16,750 holders and more than $16.8 million raised, all of which are positive indicators of institutional and whale confidence. Mutuum Finance is the smart, utility-backed choice over meme-driven cryptocurrencies like DOGE. Thumzup Media’s $2.5M Investment Has the Potential to Be a Game-Changer for Dogecoin’s Future Dogecoin (DOGE) is winning back institutional confidence after Thumzup Media, a Trump family-supported business, made a substantial $2.5 million investment. The funding will enable DogeHash Technologies to expand its mining capacity exponentially, with over 4,000 mining rigs operational prior to year-end, one of the most extensive Dogecoin mining networks in the U.S. The addition of 500 new high-performance ASIC miners will expand the hash rate of the network, accelerating transaction speed, boosting security, and building further trust in the system as a whole. Thumzup’s entry, signaled by its recent acquisition of 19 BTC and 7.5 million DOGE and eventual investment of as much as $250 million in digital assets, is an indicator of growing institutional interest and confidence in Dogecoin’s long-term potential. Analysts predict the development to catalyze broader institutional uptake and boost DOGE’s position in mainstream crypto portfolios. But as Dogecoin fundamentals keep growing stronger, increasingly more investors are also investigating Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which could offer even greater upside potential beyond the meme-coin narrative. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Traction Mutuum Finance is generating even more hype and anticipation for its presale, with the platform already raising over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 investors onboard to date. Stage 6 of the project is ongoing, during which MUTM tokens are available for purchase at $0.035 per token. In appreciation of early adopters, Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway promotion, in which 10 users will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. The protocol will have a dynamic floating interest rate mechanism that makes the most efficient use of liquidity. Low interest rate environments and excess liquidity environments encourage borrowing and ecosystem activity and high demand environments and higher interest rates encourage loan repayment and incoming capital flows. Fixed interest models function optimally when liquidity is constant, adjusting organically to overall market forces. Mutuum Finance Advances Development of Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance is going ahead with the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , a key step to enhancing its decentralized finance ecosystem. The first version (V1) of the protocol is expected on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will include functionalities such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. ETH and USDT will be supported for lending, borrowing, and collateral at the time of launch, providing users with a convenient and secure DeFi experience. Lending, borrowing, and liquidation at a profit require efficient asset valuation. To this effect, Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to retrieve live USD and principal crypto asset prices such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform realizes optimum data accuracy by utilizing fallback oracle systems, composite data feeds, and time-weighted averages from decentralized exchanges for quality valuations during the highly volatile and distressed market conditions. Dogecoin (DOGE) or Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Dogecoin’s $2.5M mining incentive shows growing interest, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a far more promising prospect. At $0.035 and with over 55% sold, 16,750+ buyers and $16.8M invested, MUTM’s twin lending ecosystem, real-yield tokenomics, and upcoming DeFi protocol render it a utility-based altcoin with tremendous growth potential, which makes DOGE seem like a less desirable option for serious investors.

        "body": "Blockchain network revenue fell 16% month-over-month in September as reduced crypto volatility lowered demand for high-priority transactions, driving network fees down across major chains such as Ethereum, Solana and Tron. Network revenue fell 16% MoM in September Ethereum fees down 6%, Solana down 11%, Tron fees dropped 37% after a governance fee cut. Volatility fell sharply: ETH -40%, SOL -16%, BTC -26% — reducing arbitrage-driven fee demand. Blockchain network revenue fell 16% in September due to lower crypto volatility; read the full analysis, data, and investor takeaways. Learn how fees and fundamentals changed. Asset manager VanEck attributed the broad decline in blockchain network revenue in September to lower volatility in the crypto markets. What caused the decline in blockchain network revenue in September? Blockchain network revenue declined 16% month-over-month in September primarily because lower crypto volatility reduced traders’ need to pay priority fees, decreasing total fees across major networks. VanEck’s analysis cites reduced arbitrage and fewer high-priority transactions as the main drivers. VanEck reported that overall network revenues across the blockchain ecosystem dropped by 16% month-over-month in September, linked to diminished volatility and lower transaction fee demand. Ethereum network revenue fell by 6% and Solana’s by 11%. The Tron network recorded a 37% reduction in fees, which VanEck attributes to a governance proposal that halved gas fees in August. Most cryptocurrencies experienced reduced volatility in September. Source: VanEck How did volatility changes affect crypto network fees? Reduced volatility curtailed arbitrage and time-sensitive trading that typically pushes users to pay higher fees for faster settlement. Ether (ETH) volatility dropped about 40% in September, SOL volatility fell 16%, and BTC volatility declined 26%, according to VanEck’s figures. Lower volatility means fewer rapid price moves and thus fewer priority transactions, translating directly into lower network revenue and smaller fee pools for validators and miners. Why did Tron lead revenue metrics despite lower fees? Tron remains the top revenue-generating crypto ecosystem, producing roughly $3.6 billion over the last year, according to Token Terminal data cited in market reporting. This leadership stems largely from stablecoin activity — 51% of circulating Tether USDt supply is issued on the Tron network. A comparison of crypto network fees over the last year. Source: Token Terminal By comparison, Ethereum generated about $1 billion in annual revenue despite ETH reaching all-time highs in August and a market capitalization near $539 billion — roughly 16x TRX’s market cap of about $32 billion. Stablecoins continue to expand: the stablecoin market cap crossed $292 billion in October 2025, per RWA.XYZ data, reinforcing Tron’s role in settlement and recurring fee generation. How should investors interpret network revenue and fees? Network revenues and fees are a core metric for assessing blockchain economic activity and protocol health. Monitor fees as a short-term gauge of transaction demand and revenue as a longer-term indicator of platform monetization and product fit. Analysts track fundamentals such as active addresses, transaction value, and fee revenue to evaluate project trajectories and ecosystem resilience. Frequently Asked Questions How large was the month-over-month revenue decline in September? The blockchain ecosystem saw a 16% month-over-month decline in network revenue in September, driven largely by reduced volatility and lower priority-fee transactions. Did any networks buck the trend in September? Tron continued to lead annual revenue generation despite a 37% monthly fee drop, thanks to heavy stablecoin settlement activity and prior fee-structure changes. What role did governance changes play in fee reductions? On Tron, a governance proposal reduced gas fees by over 50% in August, contributing to a 37% drop in network fees in September as reflected in revenue data. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"What caused the decline in blockchain network revenue in September?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Reduced crypto volatility lowered arbitrage and priority-fee demand, leading to a 16% month-over-month decline in blockchain network revenue in September.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Why did Tron still lead revenue metrics?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Tron generated the most annual revenue due to heavy stablecoin settlement activity, with 51% of circulating USDT issued on Tron, supporting recurring fee volume.\" } } ]} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Blockchain network revenue drops in September as volatility falls\", \"description\": \"VanEck reports a 16% month-over-month decline in blockchain network revenue in September driven by reduced crypto volatility and lower transaction fees.\", \"image\": [\"https://en.coinotag.com/images/0199b0f3-c6e7-7260-b34f-183b28f6d0b8\"], \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-04T08:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-04T08:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png\" } }, \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com\" }} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to interpret a drop in blockchain network revenue\", \"description\": \"A brief step-by-step guide for investors to assess causes and implications of falling network fees and revenue.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Check volatility metrics\", \"text\": \"Compare ETH, SOL, and BTC volatility changes to see if lower price swings explain fee reductions.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Review protocol governance changes\", \"text\": \"Identify recent fee-structure proposals, such as Tron’s gas fee cut, which can materially reduce revenue.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Analyze stablecoin flows\", \"text\": \"Assess stablecoin issuance and settlement trends, as stablecoin volume can sustain fee revenue even in low-volatility markets.\" } ]} Key Takeaways Revenue decline: A 16% MoM drop in September shows fees are sensitive to volatility and governance changes. Network leaders: Tron leads annual revenue ($3.6B) due to stablecoin settlement dominance; Ethereum earned ~$1B. Investor action: Monitor volatility, fee policy changes, and stablecoin flows to assess short- and long-term revenue trends. Conclusion September’s 16% fall in blockchain network revenue reflects lower crypto volatility and targeted protocol changes that cut fees. Investors should combine fee analytics with on-chain activity and stablecoin trends to evaluate ecosystem health. Review network fundamentals regularly to inform allocation and risk decisions.",

SEC reviews 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs as shutdown delays approval and review timelines. New ETFs include staked tokens like ADA, AVAX, and NEAR, offering both yield and price exposure. Up to 40% of ETF assets may be invested in non-U.S. crypto ETPs from 21Shares, CoinShares, and Valour. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing multiple staking-based crypto ETF filings while operating with reduced staff during a government shutdown. REX Shares and Osprey Funds have proposed 21 spot ETFs that combine staking rewards with token price exposure, broadening regulated access to altcoins for institutional and retail investors. What are the REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs under SEC review? REX-Osprey staking crypto ETFs are proposed funds that would hold and stake selected proof-of-stake tokens, paying staking rewards to the ETF while tracking token price movements. The filings name tokens such as ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SEI and SUI and outline use of Cayman subsidiaries to meet regulatory and tax requirements. How do these ETFs combine yield and price exposure? The funds are structured to both participate in on-chain staking (generating rewards) and provide market exposure to token price changes. Staking rewards would be retained or distributed according to each fund’s prospectus. Issuers emphasize the ability to deliver staking yield without investors directly managing private keys. Why is the SEC review delayed and what are the regulatory implications? The SEC’s standard review period for ETF filings is approximately 75 days, but reduced staffing from the government shutdown has slowed processing. Past shutdowns, such as in 2018, caused notable approval delays; analysts expect a similar impact now. Any approvals will still need to satisfy custody, custody-provider oversight, and compliance requirements for staking activities. Which tokens and issuers are named in filings? Filings list staked tokens including ADA, AVAX, DOT, NEAR, SEI, SUI, TAO and HYPE. The documents reference allocation flexibility allowing up to 40% of fund assets to be invested in non-U.S. exchange-traded products from issuers named in plain text: 21Shares, CoinShares and Valour. Issuers plan Cayman Islands feeder structures to preserve regulated investment company status under U.S. tax rules. How might investor exposure differ compared to existing spot ETFs? Staking crypto ETFs differ from spot ETFs by adding a yield component from protocol-level staking. Investors gain passive yield (subject to slashing and validator performance) in addition to price appreciation or depreciation. The funds aim to reduce operational friction for institutional investors while preserving tradability on U.S. exchanges. Summary comparison of proposed ETFs (example allocation) ETF Primary Token Staking Enabled Potential Non‑U.S. Allocation Target Investor REX-Osprey ADA Staked ETF ADA Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional REX-Osprey AVAX Staked ETF AVAX Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional REX-Osprey NEAR Staked ETF NEAR Yes Up to 40% Retail & Institutional When could decisions resume and what should investors watch? Approvals are likely to resume once full SEC operations return; October 2025 is noted as a key month for several pending crypto ETF deadlines. Investors should monitor SEC notices, prospectus amendments, and custody disclosures for staking mechanics, fee schedules, and counterparty arrangements. Frequently Asked Questions Will staking ETFs increase investor access to altcoins? Yes. Staking ETFs aim to broaden access by allowing investors to gain price and yield exposure through regulated vehicles, avoiding direct custody and staking complexities. Product terms will determine yield distribution and fee impact. Can fund assets be invested in non-U.S. ETPs? Yes. Filings state up to 40% of a fund’s assets may be invested in non-U.S. crypto exchange-traded products from issuers referenced in the filings. This may diversify access to European and Canadian markets within a U.S.-listed wrapper. Are staking rewards guaranteed? No. Staking rewards depend on network conditions, validator performance and protocol rules. Rewards can fluctuate and may be subject to penalties such as slashing for misbehavior or downtime. Key Takeaways Regulatory review active : The SEC is reviewing 21 REX-Osprey staking crypto ETF filings; approval timelines are delayed by a government shutdown. Yield + market exposure : Proposed ETFs combine staking rewards with token price exposure for altcoins like ADA, AVAX and NEAR. Cross-border allocation : Up to 40% non-U.S. ETP allocation may link funds to international issuers while using Cayman subsidiaries for tax and regulatory alignment. Conclusion The SEC’s review of staking crypto ETFs from REX and Osprey could expand regulated yield-bearing access to major altcoins, but approval timing remains uncertain due to the government shutdown.

        "body": "Asset management giant VanEck has published its cryptocurrency market report for September 2025. The report noted that Digital Asset Treasuries (DAT) holdings have reached approximately $135 billion, with institutional investors, in particular, continuing to accumulate and stake ETH. VanEck noted that this creates a dilution risk for investors outside of staking. The report also touched on Ethereum's upcoming Fusaka upgrade in December. This update is expected to reduce Layer-2 rollup costs by increasing blob capacity and improve network efficiency by allowing nodes to perform block validation using probabilistic sampling. According to VanEck's report, 23 of the 35 major tokens closed the month lower. Bitcoin (BTC) rose 5%, while Ethereum (ETH) fell 5%. The overall decline in market volatility has dampened both price action and blockchain revenue, causing stagnation in the sector. According to the report, blockchain revenues fell by 16% month-over-month: Ethereum revenues: -6% Solana revenues: -11% Tron revenues: -37% VanEck stated that the primary reason for this decline was the decrease in market volatility. In September, volatility fell by -40% for ETH, -26% for BTC, and -16% for SOL. While decentralized spot exchange (DEX) volumes remained at August levels of approximately $365 billion, futures volumes increased by 30%. Much of this increase was driven by the token launch of the Aster platform within the Binance ecosystem and incentivized trading pairs.

Top performing tokens in September: Mantle (MNT): +53% Avalanche (AVAX): +24% Binance Coin (BNB): +16% The weakest performers are: Polygon (POL): -19% Arbitrum (ARB): -17% Toncoin (TON): -14% VanEck noted that since 2016, September has generally been marked by negative returns. On average, Bitcoin loses 3% of its value in September, while Ethereum loses 7%. The year 2025 is no exception to this historical trend. *This is not investment advice.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-high-can-ethereum-eth-go-this-uptober-chatgpt-breaks-it-down-and-names-a-cheaper-must-buy-crypto-for-2025/",
        "body": "The Uptober month is already living up to its name, with Ethereum (ETH) returning to the limelight as specialists foresee a possible breakout higher than $5,000, and as high as $5,500. More institutional inflows, optimism regarding the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, and higher Layer-2 adoption are all helping to create bullish momentum for the world’s second-largest altcoin. But while ETH’s potential upside remains strong, investors are becoming more interested in a much more high-upside play, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with far greater growth potential at a fraction of the expense. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance has been one of the most popular DeFi projects in 2025 with its twin lending infrastructure, real-yield mechanics, and non-custodial smart contracts tackling critical inefficiencies of decentralized finance. With Stage 6 of its presale over 55% sold out, 16,750+ holders, and over $16.8 million raised, MUTM could outshine ETH in the next run. Ethereum (ETH) Positions Itself for a Strong Uptober Rally Ethereum (ETH) is positioning itself for a potential explosive rally in October 2025, with prices keeping their strength around $4,300 after a steep bounce above $4,000. October, which is known as “Uptober” among traders, historically comes with average returns of nearly 5%, and this time the setup looks even stronger. Institutional demand is increasing as ETH investment funds attract hundreds of millions of inflows, with big players such as BlackRock ongoing in developing its network. At the same time, 30% of the ETH supply is now staked, locking up coins and removing circulating supply from the network, as deflationary token burns further tighten market dynamics. With exhausted exchange reserves, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the bullish BTC trend, and greater crypto euphoria around key U.S. events, analysts say that a breakout above $5,000 is eminently within the realm of possibility. But although ETH displays dazzling upside, the vast majority of investors seeking greater growth potential are starting to eye Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for out-of-proportion returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge as Investor Frenzy Hits All-Time High Mutuum Finance has been providing early adopters with the special opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a lower cost before the project is officially launched. Phase 6 tokens available at $0.035 have been extremely sought after, presale already reaching over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 owners. The figures say volumes of active market enthusiasm and increasing faith in the future of the long-term business. Besides locking down the platform and engaging with community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program with an official $50,000 USDT bug bounty pool. The program invites white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to report codebase vulnerabilities with rewards paid out depending on severity. This ensures that even the minor problems are addressed as quickly as possible and general platform security is high. Mutuum Finance to Roll Out New DeFi Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has announced the upcoming release of its own lending and borrowing protocol , a giant leap towards decentralized finance. The V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have the fundamental components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Since ETH and USDT are supported from the start for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing, the platform aims to offer a stable and scalable foundation for users of DeFi. To access recent and real-time prices, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles along with high-cap token feeds like USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references are provided, which allow multi-layered functionality to supply robust and secure price data in the face of ultra-abnormal market chaos. Ethereum’s “Uptober” rally may propel ETH to over $5,000, yet its potential is capped compared to the early-stage possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at only $0.035 is already more than 55% sold in phase 6 with $16.8M raised, presents much greater growth potential. Its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield structure, and robust presale traction make MUTM the top DeFi altcoin for investors seeking disproportionate 2025 returns.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/are-these-the-2-best-cryptos-to-buy-as-trump-backed-thumzup-media-expands-dogecoin-mining-with-2-5m-investment/",
        "body": "Thumzup Media, a Trump-backed company, has announced that it has invested $2.5 million in ramping up Dogecoin mining activities with hundreds of additional ASIC rigs and a significant boost in network hash power. The move has rekindled bullish interest in Dogecoin (DOGE), with some speculating that institutional entry may take its price beyond the $1 mark during the next bull run. That said, though DOGE’s momentum is worth keeping an eye on, more seasoned investors are now turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with much greater upside potential. Now at only $0.035, Mutuum Finance has already emerged as one of 2025’s most formidable DeFi plays thanks to its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield tokenomics, and non-custodial smart contract architecture. Presale Stage 6 is already over 55% sold, with more than 16,750 holders and more than $16.8 million raised, all of which are positive indicators of institutional and whale confidence. Mutuum Finance is the smart, utility-backed choice over meme-driven cryptocurrencies like DOGE. Thumzup Media’s $2.5M Investment Has the Potential to Be a Game-Changer for Dogecoin’s Future Dogecoin (DOGE) is winning back institutional confidence after Thumzup Media, a Trump family-supported business, made a substantial $2.5 million investment. The funding will enable DogeHash Technologies to expand its mining capacity exponentially, with over 4,000 mining rigs operational prior to year-end, one of the most extensive Dogecoin mining networks in the U.S. The addition of 500 new high-performance ASIC miners will expand the hash rate of the network, accelerating transaction speed, boosting security, and building further trust in the system as a whole. Thumzup’s entry, signaled by its recent acquisition of 19 BTC and 7.5 million DOGE and eventual investment of as much as $250 million in digital assets, is an indicator of growing institutional interest and confidence in Dogecoin’s long-term potential. Analysts predict the development to catalyze broader institutional uptake and boost DOGE’s position in mainstream crypto portfolios. But as Dogecoin fundamentals keep growing stronger, increasingly more investors are also investigating Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which could offer even greater upside potential beyond the meme-coin narrative. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Traction Mutuum Finance is generating even more hype and anticipation for its presale, with the platform already raising over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 investors onboard to date. Stage 6 of the project is ongoing, during which MUTM tokens are available for purchase at $0.035 per token. In appreciation of early adopters, Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway promotion, in which 10 users will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. The protocol will have a dynamic floating interest rate mechanism that makes the most efficient use of liquidity. Low interest rate environments and excess liquidity environments encourage borrowing and ecosystem activity and high demand environments and higher interest rates encourage loan repayment and incoming capital flows. Fixed interest models function optimally when liquidity is constant, adjusting organically to overall market forces. Mutuum Finance Advances Development of Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance is going ahead with the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , a key step to enhancing its decentralized finance ecosystem. The first version (V1) of the protocol is expected on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will include functionalities such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. ETH and USDT will be supported for lending, borrowing, and collateral at the time of launch, providing users with a convenient and secure DeFi experience. Lending, borrowing, and liquidation at a profit require efficient asset valuation. To this effect, Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to retrieve live USD and principal crypto asset prices such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform realizes optimum data accuracy by utilizing fallback oracle systems, composite data feeds, and time-weighted averages from decentralized exchanges for quality valuations during the highly volatile and distressed market conditions. Dogecoin (DOGE) or Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Dogecoin’s $2.5M mining incentive shows growing interest, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a far more promising prospect. At $0.035 and with over 55% sold, 16,750+ buyers and $16.8M invested, MUTM’s twin lending ecosystem, real-yield tokenomics, and upcoming DeFi protocol render it a utility-based altcoin with tremendous growth potential, which makes DOGE seem like a less desirable option for serious investors.

This update is expected to reduce Layer-2 rollup costs by increasing blob capacity and improve network efficiency by allowing nodes to perform block validation using probabilistic sampling. According to VanEck's report, 23 of the 35 major tokens closed the month lower. Bitcoin (BTC) rose 5%, while Ethereum (ETH) fell 5%. The overall decline in market volatility has dampened both price action and blockchain revenue, causing stagnation in the sector. According to the report, blockchain revenues fell by 16% month-over-month: Ethereum revenues: -6% Solana revenues: -11% Tron revenues: -37% VanEck stated that the primary reason for this decline was the decrease in market volatility. In September, volatility fell by -40% for ETH, -26% for BTC, and -16% for SOL. While decentralized spot exchange (DEX) volumes remained at August levels of approximately $365 billion, futures volumes increased by 30%. Much of this increase was driven by the token launch of the Aster platform within the Binance ecosystem and incentivized trading pairs.

        "body": "XRP investors are on edge following a new update that’s sending ripples through the crypto community. This isn’t about hype or speculation—it’s a data-driven analysis of what could be a defining moment for XRP’s price movement. According to a prominent analyst, this setup might be the very opportunity XRP holders have been waiting for. A Defining Moment for XRP Holders In a video shared on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO sounded the alarm: “XRP holders, this could literally be the moment we have been waiting for here on the channel.” He explained that XRP had been consolidating within a bull flag pattern since mid-July and is now beginning to show “very bullish signs.” Steph emphasized that this pattern could lead to a major breakout in the coming days or weeks if confirmed, saying, “I want you guys to be prepared for this. I want to show you exactly what my game plan is, what my expectations are. Is the momentum bullish? Is there a potential bull trap? What’s the best thing right now?” IF YOU HOLD #XRP I GOT NEWS FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!! (urgent) pic.twitter.com/AkTJkXiv6i — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 3, 2025 The Key Confirmation Level: $3 Daily Close The analyst stressed that confirmation is essential before calling a full breakout: “For me to absolutely call and to confirm this breakout, I would need to see the daily candle of today close above three dollars.” According to Steph, a confirmed daily close above this level would strongly suggest that XRP is “most likely heading a lot higher in the next days and the next weeks.” He maintained a technical target of around $5 , derived from the height of the bull flag’s pole, but cautioned traders to remain realistic. “There are no guarantees on the way up,” he said. “Maybe XRP is not going to go to five dollars—maybe we’re going to stop at four dollars or $4.50. It’s important that you have an exit strategy and that you secure profits on the way up.” Bullish Momentum Confirmed by EMA Ribbons Steph also highlighted a significant technical signal—the EMA ribbons on the daily chart. He noted that XRP is “right now actually breaking above daily ribbons, which is a strong sign and shows a lot of bullish momentum, a lot of buying pressure going on.” Historically, when XRP breaks above these ribbons, it often indicates the start of a larger upward move, especially if accompanied by increasing volume. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He added that the broader market context supports this potential surge. “Historically, October and November tend to be very bullish for crypto and for XRP,” he explained. “I think Q4—the next few days and the next few weeks—could be very bullish for XRP . But once again, for absolute confirmation, wait for the daily candle of today to close above three dollars.” Market Context and Outlook As of now, XRP trades just below the critical $3 threshold, consolidating after several attempts to break higher. Analysts widely agree that this level represents a major resistance zone. A confirmed breakout above it could open the door to a sustained rally toward $4–$5, while rejection might lead to renewed consolidation or a temporary pullback. For long-term investors, Steph’s message serves as both encouragement and caution. The current technical setup appears promising, but as he reminded his audience, “There are no guarantees on the way up.” Ultimately, the coming days will determine whether XRP confirms its long-awaited breakout. Traders and holders alike are watching the charts closely—because in crypto, decisive moments often arrive without warning, and being prepared can make all the difference.

        "url": "https://timestabloid.com/heres-what-xrp-market-cap-multiplier-effect-means/",
        "body": "Every crypto bull market has its buzzwords, but few have sparked as much curiosity among XRP holders as the so-called “market cap multiplier effect.” It’s the idea that XRP’s true price potential isn’t limited by its large total supply — because only a fraction of that supply is actively available on the market. In other words, XRP’s liquidity reality may be far smaller than its theoretical supply, meaning smaller inflows of capital could trigger disproportionately large price reactions. Understanding the Market Cap Multiplier In a recent video, Jake Claver, managing partner at Digital Wealth Partners, tackled the growing debate head-on: “People look at total supply of XRP when, in reality, the supply-demand dynamics are going to be on the available supply of XRP,” he explained. This distinction — between XRP’s total supply of 100 billion and the much smaller circulating amount that actually trades — is at the heart of the multiplier effect. Let's look at what the XRP market cap multiplier effect means pic.twitter.com/5tiUdpHt6i — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) October 3, 2025 Claver illustrated this with a practical example: “There might be 2 billion XRP left on exchanges — probably less than that if you include retail and what they’re going to exit or sell.” He added that even if XRP’s price skyrockets to $10, $20, or even $50, some retail investors would inevitably sell portions of their holdings, adding perhaps another billion XRP to the liquid market. But that still represents a small share of total supply. The Math Behind the Multiplier Claver broke down the logic simply: “If you only had, let’s say, 2 billion [XRP] out of 100 billion, you’d be that 50x that Zach Rector talks about. It’s total supply versus available supply — and that’s why you get a shift in how much liquidity moving in is going to cause the market cap to rise in a multiplier effect.” When buyers enter the market, their demand impacts a smaller pool of available tokens, rather than the total supply. This limited float magnifies price movements, which in turn amplifies market capitalization faster than would occur in a fully distributed asset. Institutional Holdings and Market Liquidity Claver also revealed that his firm, Digital Wealth Partners, currently manages around 200 million XRP, accounting for roughly 8% of retail-owned XRP, based on his estimates. This institutional custody further concentrates holdings, reducing the amount of XRP readily available on exchanges. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 “Retail doesn’t hold more than maybe 1.2 to 2 billion total XRP in my opinion,” he said, emphasizing that these liquidity dynamics are critical for understanding XRP’s future price behavior. Broader Context and Implications While the multiplier concept doesn’t change XRP’s total supply — which remains capped at 100 billion — it reframes how market participants should interpret liquidity and price discovery. Ripple’s monthly escrow releases , typically capped at 1 billion XRP, also control how much new supply enters circulation, keeping active liquidity relatively tight. The takeaway is clear: XRP’s potential price response is not purely a function of total supply, but of how much XRP is actually tradable. As Claver summarized, “It’s total supply versus available supply. That’s the reason there is a multiplier effect.” The XRP market cap multiplier effect shows how small changes in liquidity can lead to significant price movements. It’s not speculation — it’s a structural feature of how XRP trades in real-world conditions, where limited availability magnifies every dollar of demand that flows into the asset.

        "body": "Markets have a way of testing conviction before rewarding it. For XRP holders, that moment of quiet before the storm feels closer than ever. After months of sideways consolidation and growing impatience, many analysts now believe XRP is positioning itself for a powerful move — one that could redefine its market trajectory when it finally unfolds. The Setup: Pattern and Price Renowned market observer The Crypto Philosopher recently shared a striking technical comparison between XRP’s current structure and Amazon’s chart from the early 2000s. In the video, XRP’s weekly chart is overlaid with Amazon’s long-term base that preceded its historic 14x rally from $5 to $70. The resemblance, he argues, is no coincidence. A cup-and-handle pattern is emerging in XRP’s chart, a classic bullish setup that typically precedes a significant upward move. According to The Crypto Philosopher, XRP’s current support sits firmly around $2.70, with a critical breakout level near $3.02. A confirmed move above this resistance, especially with increasing trading volume, could ignite a parabolic run — mirroring the way Amazon’s breakout unleashed years of compounding gains. Xrp is on the brink of its parabolic run It’ll happen when you least expect it Just keep waiting pic.twitter.com/laTpiG5nzE — The Crypto Philosopher (@TheCryptoP73649) October 2, 2025 The Amazon Analogy and Its Implications The comparison to Amazon is notable because it suggests XRP is following a similar pattern of accumulation before explosive growth. Just as Amazon built a foundation for years after the dot-com crash, XRP has been laying groundwork despite market doubts and regulatory challenges. While parallels between equities and digital assets should be drawn with caution, the core logic remains: strong fundamentals, persistent development, and an extended consolidation phase can set the stage for substantial upward revaluation. In XRP’s case, the alignment of technical structure, liquidity positioning, and renewed investor sentiment strengthens the bullish argument. The Expected Timeline If the pattern continues to unfold as projected, XRP could be entering the final stretch of its handle formation, a period that typically lasts from several days to a few weeks before a breakout confirmation. Analysts suggest that a decisive close above $3.02 would mark the official start of the next leg up. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From there, momentum could accelerate rapidly, driven by institutional inflows, renewed market confidence, and increased adoption of Ripple’s technologies in real-world payments and tokenization. However, timing remains fluid. True parabolic runs rarely announce themselves in advance. As The Crypto Philosopher aptly noted, “It’ll happen when you least expect it.” Risks and Confirmation Signals Despite the bullish outlook, traders are urged to remain disciplined. False breakouts can occur, especially in a volatile market. To confirm the trend, analysts suggest looking for three key indicators: sustained volume growth, successful retests of new support levels, and overall crypto market strength driven by Bitcoin. In summary, XRP’s technical setup is nearing a crucial inflection point. If price and volume converge as anticipated, the conditions for a parabolic surge could soon align — turning patience into payoff for long-term believers. Yet, as every seasoned trader knows, conviction must be matched with caution, because even the most promising charts demand validation before the real run begins.

In 2031, the TIA price forecast expects a maximum price of $156.88. Celestia generated significant interest before its October 2023 launch. This was largely due to the strong backing from major crypto exchanges from the outset and the intriguing technical concepts behind the Celestia modular blockchain network. In this article, we’ll provide a Celestia price prediction, analyze the factors driving these projections, and explore what the Celestia modular blockchain network brings to the broader crypto landscape. Overview Cryptocurrency Celestia Token TIA Price $1.47 (-1.8%) Market cap $1.68 Billion Trading volume (24-hour) $87.3 Million Circulating supply 639.85 Million TIA All-time high $20.91; Feb 10, 2024 All-time low $2.03; Oct 31, 2023 24-hour high $1.6 24-hour low $1.38 TIA price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $ 1.47 Price Prediction $ 1.10 (-25.15%) Fear & Greed Index 71 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 9.65% Green Days 16/30 (53%) 50-Day SMA $ 1.66 200-Day SMA $ 2.28 14-Day RSI 44.76 TIA price analysis: TIA price faces a selling pressure toward $1.45 TIA price analysis shows volatility toward $1.45 Resistance for TIA is present at $1.587 Support for TIA/USD is present at $1.325 The TIA price analysis for October 4 confirms that TIA is witnessing bearish volatility toward the $1.45 level.

TIA is trading at $1.46, declining by over 1.8% in the last 24 hours. TIA/USD chart. Image source: TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and hovers around the 42-level, showing that bears are controlling the momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests lower volatility for the next few hours. TIA/USD 4-hour price chart: Bears aim for a hold below moving averages The 4-hour TIA price chart suggests TIA continues to experience intense volatility between $1 and $1.5, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. Currently, bears aim for a strong domination as the price prepares for a hold below EMA lines. TIA/USD chart. Image source: TradingView The BoP indicator is bullish at 0, suggesting that buyers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost upward correction.

Image source: TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, the TIA price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.325, resulting in a correction to $1.106. Is TIA a good investment? Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price is attempting to hold below $1.5 as buyers lost confidence, resulting in a decline below Fib channels. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. It is advised to do own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile crypto market.

Investors are curious whether these quirky coins can trigger a new wave of excitement in the market. Could these underdogs lead to a fresh rally? Explore the potential growth drivers and market sentiment in the full article. Dogecoin on the Rise: Is a Surge Around the Corner? Source: tradingview Dogecoin is currently trading between twenty-two and twenty-six cents. Its recent upward trend has seen a price surge of over 15% this week and nearly 20% for the month. The coin's momentum hints at breaking through the nearest resistance level of about twenty-eight cents. If it continues this path, it might soon challenge the second resistance level of roughly thirty-two cents. This could signal a potential growth of over 25%. With its popularity and community backing, Dogecoin remains a digital currency to watch, as its price movements suggest more potential climbs in the future. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR Pepe (PEPE) Price Watch: What to Expect from this Crypto Adventure Source: tradingview Pepe (PEPE) is showing mixed signals. Its current price range swings between a few thousandths of a cent, landing at around $0.000009. Despite it passing a week with almost a 9% rise, the momentum is cautious. It's below the 10-day moving average but slightly above the 100-day average, which points to stable but slow progress. If Pepe breaks the nearest resistance level, it could see a growth of about 15% from its current spot. However, dropping below support could mean a slide of 20%. With its RSI below 50, Pepe’s current potential leans more towards recovery than rapid growth. Conclusion DOGE and PEPE have both shown potential for growth. DOGE remains popular with a strong community backing. PEPE has recently gained attention due to its memes and social media trends. If interest in meme coins continues, both could see price increases. However, market dynamics always play a big role. Keeping an eye on market trends and investor interest is crucial for predicting future movements of these coins. Just as crucial as crafting a narrative that fits the market, the key ability of Outset PR.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/",
        "body": "Key Takeaways: Our Ordinals price prediction anticipates a high of $29.81 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $8 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $8.32 Market cap $174.77M 24-hour trading volume $38.73M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2024 24-hour high $8.95 24-hour low $8.18 Ordi price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 8.87% 50-day SMA $9.05 200-day SMA $9.34 Sentiment Bearish Green days 16/30 (53%) Fear and Greed Index 71 (Greed) Ordi price analysis On the day of writing (October 4), ORDI’s price dropped by 5.51% in 24 hours and 0.11% in the last seven days. Its trading volume dropped by 17.16% showing less trader conviction in the market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades along the Williams alligator trendlines, signaling an uneventful market as the price bounced off support levels ($7.70 Fibonacci midpoint) and key moving averages. The coin has registered negative momentum in the last 7 days. The MACD and signal lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, signaling a bear market. At the same time, the relative strength index is in neutral territory at 44.51. It is oversold when the RSI falls below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI is moving sideways at the $8.39 mark with MACD confirmation (-0.029). The William Alligator trendlines show falling volatility. ORDI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 8.69 SELL SMA 5 8.40 SELL SMA 10 8.46 SELL SMA 21 9.09 SELL SMA 50 9.05 SELL SMA 100 9.17 SELL SMA 200 9.34 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 8.78 SELL EMA 5 8.85 SELL EMA 10 8.91 SELL EMA 21 9.05 SELL EMA 50 9.17 SELL EMA 100 9.38 SELL EMA 200 11.87 SELL What to expect from ORDI price analysis next? ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. Over the short term, ORDI remains correlated with Bitcoin, which is just below $122,000. The charts show it will continue downwards but with less volatility. Why is ORDI down? ORDI’s drop reflects technical triggers, Bitcoin-driven risk aversion, and technical overextension. Its status as a “Bitcoin beta” leaves it exposed during dominance rallies, while thin liquidity magnifies moves. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100?

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10. In October, it traded above the $8 mark.",

        "body": "The Uptober month is already living up to its name, with Ethereum (ETH) returning to the limelight as specialists foresee a possible breakout higher than $5,000, and as high as $5,500. More institutional inflows, optimism regarding the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, and higher Layer-2 adoption are all helping to create bullish momentum for the world’s second-largest altcoin. But while ETH’s potential upside remains strong, investors are becoming more interested in a much more high-upside play, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with far greater growth potential at a fraction of the expense. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance has been one of the most popular DeFi projects in 2025 with its twin lending infrastructure, real-yield mechanics, and non-custodial smart contracts tackling critical inefficiencies of decentralized finance. With Stage 6 of its presale over 55% sold out, 16,750+ holders, and over $16.8 million raised, MUTM could outshine ETH in the next run. Ethereum (ETH) Positions Itself for a Strong Uptober Rally Ethereum (ETH) is positioning itself for a potential explosive rally in October 2025, with prices keeping their strength around $4,300 after a steep bounce above $4,000. October, which is known as “Uptober” among traders, historically comes with average returns of nearly 5%, and this time the setup looks even stronger. Institutional demand is increasing as ETH investment funds attract hundreds of millions of inflows, with big players such as BlackRock ongoing in developing its network. At the same time, 30% of the ETH supply is now staked, locking up coins and removing circulating supply from the network, as deflationary token burns further tighten market dynamics. With exhausted exchange reserves, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the bullish BTC trend, and greater crypto euphoria around key U.S. events, analysts say that a breakout above $5,000 is eminently within the realm of possibility. But although ETH displays dazzling upside, the vast majority of investors seeking greater growth potential are starting to eye Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for out-of-proportion returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge as Investor Frenzy Hits All-Time High Mutuum Finance has been providing early adopters with the special opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a lower cost before the project is officially launched. Phase 6 tokens available at $0.035 have been extremely sought after, presale already reaching over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 owners. The figures say volumes of active market enthusiasm and increasing faith in the future of the long-term business. Besides locking down the platform and engaging with community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program with an official $50,000 USDT bug bounty pool. The program invites white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to report codebase vulnerabilities with rewards paid out depending on severity. This ensures that even the minor problems are addressed as quickly as possible and general platform security is high. Mutuum Finance to Roll Out New DeFi Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has announced the upcoming release of its own lending and borrowing protocol , a giant leap towards decentralized finance. The V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have the fundamental components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Since ETH and USDT are supported from the start for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing, the platform aims to offer a stable and scalable foundation for users of DeFi. To access recent and real-time prices, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles along with high-cap token feeds like USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references are provided, which allow multi-layered functionality to supply robust and secure price data in the face of ultra-abnormal market chaos. Ethereum’s “Uptober” rally may propel ETH to over $5,000, yet its potential is capped compared to the early-stage possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at only $0.035 is already more than 55% sold in phase 6 with $16.8M raised, presents much greater growth potential. Its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield structure, and robust presale traction make MUTM the top DeFi altcoin for investors seeking disproportionate 2025 returns.

In 2030, it will range between $2.98 and $3.51, with an average price of $3.08. Layer 2s have made quite a buzz over the last few months because of their high network activity. Arbitrum led the Layer 2 pack with a total value locked ( TVL ) of $2.53 billion. Arbitrum is an Optimistic Rollup solution that shifts network operations away from the Ethereum mainnet while maintaining Ethereum-level security. Arbitrum’s BOLD testnet also went live; when integrated into the mainnet, the update will enable permissionless validation on Arbitrum. This means that anyone can challenge the state of the Arbitrum network. Currently, validators are allow-listed. Is Arbitrum a good investment? Will it go up? Where will it be in 5 years? Let’s answer these questions and more in our Arbitrum price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Arbitrum Ticker ARB Current price $0.4326 Market cap $2.33B Trading volume $207.99 Circulating supply 5.4B All-time high $2.40 on Jan 12, 2024 All-time low $0.245 on Apr 7, 2025 24-hour high $0.4563 24-hour low $0.4274 Arbitrum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 8.68% 50-day SMA $0.4877 200-day SMA $0.4111 Sentiment Bearish Green days 14/30 (47%) Fear and Greed Index 71 (Greed) Arbitrum price analysis On October 4, Arbitrum’s price rose by 3.14% over 24 hours to $0.4326, while its trading volume decreased by 32.38% during the same period.

ARB’s dip reflects natural profit-taking after a strong quarter and shifting focus toward competing L2 developments. While the network’s fundamentals (DeFi dominance, Robinhood’s RWA integrations) remain intact, traders are cautiously awaiting clearer signals. Why is ARB down? ARB’s decline reflects a mix of technical breakdowns while ecosystem developments like VanEck’s ETF provide long-term upside; near-term risks dominate. Recent news SWIFT announced its blockchain will use Linea (Ethereum L2), challenging Arbitrum’s dominance in institutional adoption. Linea’s TVL ($2.27B) now ranks fourth among L2s. Does Arbitrum have a future? A high adoption rate is crucial for any blockchain’s long-term success and sustainability. Arbitrum’s performance in this regard is a positive sign of its future performance despite the price declines. Is Arbitrum good to buy? Arbitrum is trading at its lowest range this year, with the charts showing it is just above the oversold region. At current prices, ARB is undervalued and is likely to recover if market sentiment changes. On the other hand, the Arbitrum ecosystem’s total value locked has crossed above $2.5 billion, indicating solid utility in decentralized finance. Is Arbitrum a good investment? SkyEcosystem’s Risk Analysis has launched USDS stablecoin on Arbitrum, expanding Arbitrum’s utility, which will attract liquidity to the network. This integration could increase ARB usage, potentially boosting its price. Will Arbitrum reach $10? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ARB is unlikely to reach $10 before 2031. Can Arbitrum reach 100 dollars? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $100 in the period ending in 2031. Will Arbitrum reach $1,000? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $1,000 in the period ending in 2031. Does Arbitrum have a good long-term future? A high adoption rate is crucial for any blockchain’s long-term success and sustainability. Arbitrum’s performance in this regard is a positive sign of its future performance despite the price declines.

        "body": "Markets have a way of testing conviction before rewarding it. For XRP holders, that moment of quiet before the storm feels closer than ever. After months of sideways consolidation and growing impatience, many analysts now believe XRP is positioning itself for a powerful move — one that could redefine its market trajectory when it finally unfolds. The Setup: Pattern and Price Renowned market observer The Crypto Philosopher recently shared a striking technical comparison between XRP’s current structure and Amazon’s chart from the early 2000s. In the video, XRP’s weekly chart is overlaid with Amazon’s long-term base that preceded its historic 14x rally from $5 to $70. The resemblance, he argues, is no coincidence. A cup-and-handle pattern is emerging in XRP’s chart, a classic bullish setup that typically precedes a significant upward move. According to The Crypto Philosopher, XRP’s current support sits firmly around $2.70, with a critical breakout level near $3.02. A confirmed move above this resistance, especially with increasing trading volume, could ignite a parabolic run — mirroring the way Amazon’s breakout unleashed years of compounding gains. Xrp is on the brink of its parabolic run It’ll happen when you least expect it Just keep waiting pic.twitter.com/laTpiG5nzE — The Crypto Philosopher (@TheCryptoP73649) October 2, 2025 The Amazon Analogy and Its Implications The comparison to Amazon is notable because it suggests XRP is following a similar pattern of accumulation before explosive growth. Just as Amazon built a foundation for years after the dot-com crash, XRP has been laying groundwork despite market doubts and regulatory challenges. While parallels between equities and digital assets should be drawn with caution, the core logic remains: strong fundamentals, persistent development, and an extended consolidation phase can set the stage for substantial upward revaluation. In XRP’s case, the alignment of technical structure, liquidity positioning, and renewed investor sentiment strengthens the bullish argument. The Expected Timeline If the pattern continues to unfold as projected, XRP could be entering the final stretch of its handle formation, a period that typically lasts from several days to a few weeks before a breakout confirmation. Analysts suggest that a decisive close above $3.02 would mark the official start of the next leg up. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From there, momentum could accelerate rapidly, driven by institutional inflows, renewed market confidence, and increased adoption of Ripple’s technologies in real-world payments and tokenization. However, timing remains fluid. True parabolic runs rarely announce themselves in advance. As The Crypto Philosopher aptly noted, “It’ll happen when you least expect it.” Risks and Confirmation Signals Despite the bullish outlook, traders are urged to remain disciplined. False breakouts can occur, especially in a volatile market. To confirm the trend, analysts suggest looking for three key indicators: sustained volume growth, successful retests of new support levels, and overall crypto market strength driven by Bitcoin. In summary, XRP’s technical setup is nearing a crucial inflection point. If price and volume converge as anticipated, the conditions for a parabolic surge could soon align — turning patience into payoff for long-term believers. Yet, as every seasoned trader knows, conviction must be matched with caution, because even the most promising charts demand validation before the real run begins.
