        "body": "Bitcoin traded near $124,900 this week after comments from Telegram founder Pavel Durov drew attention back to its long-term potential. Speaking on the Lex Fridman Podcast, Durov said he believes Bitcoin could eventually reach $1 million per coin, citing its fixed supply and independence from government control as key advantages. His remarks come at a time when investors are reassessing Bitcoin’s role as an alternative to inflation-prone fiat currencies. Scarcity and Early Conviction Drive Bullish Outlook Durov said he became an early Bitcoin investor in 2013, buying several thousand coins at around $700 each. Even after steep market declines — including a drop below $200 — he chose to hold, describing Bitcoin as “digital gold.” He said its appeal lies in its independence: no central authority can seize or censor it, and its supply is permanently limited to 21 million coins. This scarcity remains central to Bitcoin’s value proposition. Increasingly, institutional investors share this view, treating BTC as a hedge against monetary expansion and weakening fiat currencies. Durov’s experience illustrates that perspective. He credits his Bitcoin holdings, rather than Telegram’s profits, for giving him the freedom to operate globally and independently. This position reinforces why many see Bitcoin as more than a speculative asset. Macro Trends Support the $1 Million Thesis Durov linked his $1 million Bitcoin projection to broader economic forces, particularly the long-term effects of expansive monetary policy. He argued that as governments continue to increase money supply to manage debt and stimulate growth, assets with fixed supply — like Bitcoin — stand to benefit. “I think this is how money should work,” he said. “Nobody can confiscate your Bitcoin, and nobody can censor you for political reasons.” Here's my 4+ hour conversation with Pavel Durov ( @durov ), founder and CEO of Telegram. This was one of the most fascinating and powerful conversations I've ever had in my life. We discuss everything from his philosophy on freedom to government bureaucracies, intelligence… pic.twitter.com/DDBTnE7A2t — Lex Fridman (@lexfridman) September 30, 2025 His view aligns with a growing sentiment among investors who see Bitcoin as a safeguard against currency erosion. With inflation pressures persisting and global debt levels rising, Bitcoin’s decentralized and finite structure provides a contrast to traditional systems that rely on central banks. Market reaction to Durov’s comments has been steady. Bitcoin’s ability to hold above $124,000 reflects continued institutional demand, despite short-term volatility persisting. For many, his remarks reinforce a longer-term narrative: that Bitcoin’s value is increasingly tied to its role as a counterweight to monetary excess rather than a short-lived speculative cycle. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Bearish Butterfly Nears Reversal Zone On the technical front , Bitcoin remains firmly in an uptrend, with price action continuing to follow the rising trendline that has defined October’s advance. The structure of higher highs and higher lows points to steady accumulation, while the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages — at $114,186 and $107,586 — provide clear dynamic support beneath the market. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The chart shows a Bearish Butterfly harmonic pattern approaching its Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) between $128,000 and $130,000. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) near 73 signals mildly overbought conditions, hinting at a short-term pause or pullback before any renewed push higher. As long as Bitcoin holds above $124,600, a move toward the $130,000 area remains likely. A clean breakout beyond that range would invalidate the bearish setup and potentially open a path toward $160,000 in the medium term. #Bitcoin consolidates near $125K as the Bearish Butterfly pattern nears its reversal zone at $128K–$130K. RSI hovers near 73, signaling short-term caution but sustained strength. A breakout above $130K could invalidate the pattern and open the path toward $160K. pic.twitter.com/ID1288MTiZ — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 7, 2025 At this stage, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above key support levels suggests consolidation rather than exhaustion. Combined with growing institutional inflows and renewed market optimism following Durov’s remarks, the broader outlook for Q4 2025 remains skewed to the upside.

        "body": "Bitcoin exchange netflows are at a three-year low, with a 14-day SMA averaging roughly –7,500 BTC, signaling sustained outflows from exchanges and reduced short-term selling pressure as long-term holders accumulate and move coins into self-custody. 14-day SMA: ~–7,500 BTC outflow Outflows are the largest since the 2022–2023 cycle, showing lower exchange liquidity. Regular withdrawals and constrained exchange supply indicate accumulation by long-term holders. Bitcoin exchange netflows hit a 3-year low, averaging –7,500 BTC over 14 days; read analysis and implications for holders and market structure. What are Bitcoin exchange netflows indicating? Bitcoin exchange netflows measure coins moving into minus out of exchanges; a sustained negative netflow means more BTC is leaving exchanges than entering, signaling lower immediate sell supply and higher accumulation by holders. This typically reduces available on‑exchange liquidity and can amplify price reactions to demand shifts. How did netflows reach a 3-year bottom? On-chain tracking shows the 14-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of exchange netflows averaging about –7,500 BTC. OnChainSchool data places recent outflows at the largest volume since the 2022–2023 cycle. These figures point to consistent withdrawals rather than short-term profit taking. Bitcoin exchange netflows reach a 3-year low, showing strong holder conviction as investors move BTC off exchanges despite record prices. The average outflow of bitcoin exchange is -7,500 BTC in 14 days, and the volume of its withdrawal is the highest since the 2022-2023 cycle. The long-term confidence and the weak pressure to enter short-term sales can be interpreted by the fact that investors keep selling BTC out of exchanges despite new all-time highs. Regular outflows and constrained exchange supply show a maturity stage of the market where accumulation is taking over the speculative activity of long-term holders. Netflows of Bitcoin exchanges have dropped to a three-year low, indicating that holders are moving coins off exchanges more rapidly than they are sending them in. This trend suggests diminishing short-term selling pressure as more BTC becomes illiquid on exchanges and more remains in long-term wallets. Outflows Reach the Largest Level Since 2022–2023 On-chain data indicates the 14-day SMA of Bitcoin exchange netflows is near –7,500 BTC, reflecting the largest withdrawal volume outside the 2022–2023 cycle. The scale of withdrawals is notable for its consistency across major exchanges. Source: OnChainSchool Fewer coins being deposited to exchanges typically means less immediate liquidity for selling. Investors moving assets into self-custody wallets demonstrates a preference for holding through volatility rather than realizing gains at current all-time highs. Reduced exchange balances tighten available supply for market participants, which can magnify price sensitivity when demand changes. The netflow trend highlights a structural shift toward accumulation over speculative turnover. Investor Behavior Signals Long-Term Confidence Outflows persisted even as Bitcoin recently reached new all-time highs, showing holders are not broadly seeking to exit positions. This retention behavior underlines confidence in long-term prospects rather than short-term profit taking. OnChainSchool’s on-chain metrics show persistent withdrawals from exchanges, signaling that investors prioritize custody and long-term storage strategies. That mindset is consistent with a maturing market dominated by accumulation. Reduced Selling Pressure Reinforces Market Stability Declining netflows correspond with lower on-exchange inventories, which typically reduces immediate selling pressure. With less BTC readily available on exchanges, price moves can become less driven by speculative liquidation and more by genuine supply-demand dynamics. Institutional participation and growing long-term holder concentration further support a less volatile distribution profile, as accumulation by strong hands decreases the frequency of rapid sell-offs. Frequently Asked Questions What does a negative exchange netflow mean for Bitcoin price? A negative exchange netflow (more outflows than inflows) reduces exchange liquidity and often creates tighter supply, which can amplify price upside if demand rises. It does not guarantee price increases but lowers immediate selling capacity. How is the 14-day SMA of exchange netflows calculated? The 14-day Simple Moving Average sums daily netflow values (inflows minus outflows) over 14 days and divides by 14. This smooths short-term noise to reveal persistent trends like the current –7,500 BTC average. Why are investors withdrawing BTC despite all-time highs? Investors often withdraw at highs to secure long-term holdings in self-custody, reduce counterparty risk, and avoid short-term liquidation. This behavior reflects confidence and a preference for accumulation over trading. Key Takeaways Outflows are significant : 14-day SMA near –7,500 BTC, highest since 2022–2023. Liquidity tightens : Fewer coins on exchanges can magnify price reactions to demand. Market maturity : Consistent accumulation suggests long-term investor conviction and reduced speculative turnover. Conclusion Bitcoin exchange netflows at a three-year low point to a market dominated by accumulation and reduced short-term selling pressure. With long-term holders moving BTC into private custody, exchange supply is tighter and market dynamics are shifting toward less speculative volatility.

        "url": "https://cryptonews.com/news/bnb-hits-second-ath-this-month-crosses-1300-barrier-is-1500-next/",
        "body": "Binance Coin ( BNB ) surged past $1,300 on October 6, 2025, marking its second all-time high within hours after initially breaking $1,200 earlier in the day, as the token flipped XRP to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Source: TradingVew The 19% weekly gain boosted BNB’s market cap to over $154 billion, surpassing both Tether and XRP behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. BNB Chain topped all blockchains in 24-hour fees, followed closely by Hyperledger and Solana. The rally coincided with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high above $126,000, as the ongoing US government shutdown drove investors to cryptocurrencies as safe-haven assets. Founder Changpeng Zhao emphasized ecosystem growth, with 30% of BNB’s supply now staked amid institutional inflows and the expansion of DeFi. The surge comes as October historically delivers a strong fourth-quarter performance for cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin averaging 79.6% gains in past Q4 periods. JUST IN: $BNB reaches new ATH of $1,300 pic.twitter.com/wVvWHElltX — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) October 7, 2025 CZ Admits Preferring X Over Binance Square Despite BNB Rally Amid these wild runs towards new ATHs, Changpeng Zhao admitted he personally prefers using X over Binance’s own social platform, Binance Square, despite the latter reaching 275 million users since launching in 2023. CZ cited security concerns as the primary reason, stating he likes to “ stay logged out on Binance.com when not making a transaction ” and can go months without logging in. He noted he uses X to reach the “non-Binance community” as the center of broader crypto discourse. There are a few reasons I use X more than Binance Square. I like to stay logged out on https://t.co/9rMMAmczvH when not making a transaction, as a security policy. I go on for months without logging in. I like to reach non Binance community. But maybe I will switch back there https://t.co/A2Jsltrsqb — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 4, 2025 The comments received mixed reactions, with critics questioning why the founder would not be active in his own ecosystem. The contrast with Elon Musk’s frequent posting on X since acquiring Twitter in 2022 stands out sharply. CZ concluded by saying he will “ maybe ” switch back to Binance Square in the future. Broader Market Rally Driven by Political Uncertainty and Institutional Demand Bitcoin’s surge past $126,000 was accompanied by over $1 billion in spot ETF inflows , including nearly $970 million from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, with trading volume up more than 20% from the prior day. Analysts attribute the rally to the April halving, pro-crypto policies under the Trump administration, and Bitcoin’s appeal amid the political uncertainty caused by the government shutdown. Just yesterday, Strategy Inc. reported a $3.9 billion unrealized gain on its 640,031 BTC holdings in the third quarter, with total fair value reaching $47.35 billion. Earlier today, VanEck’s Matthew Sigel stated that surveys indicate younger consumers are increasingly favoring Bitcoin for wealth preservation over gold. He noted that around half of gold’s market value comes from its store of value role, and if Bitcoin captured half of that market, it would imply $644,000 per coin at today’s record gold price. We’ve been saying Bitcoin should reach half of gold’s market cap after the next halving. Roughly half of gold’s value reflects its use as a store of value rather than industrial or jewelry demand, and surveys show younger consumers in emerging markets increasingly prefer Bitcoin… — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) October 7, 2025 VanEck projects that Bitcoin could settle 10% of global trade by 2050, supporting a long-term price of $2.9 million per coin, equivalent to a $61 trillion market capitalization. Technical Analysis Projects $1,500 Target Following Breakout Pattern Hourly chart analysis reveals BNB trading at $1,266.83 following a breakout from consolidation near $1,193, with upside targets of approximately $1,347 representing a 6.3% gain. Source: X/@Tryrexcrypto Conversely, downside risk lies below $1,183, which would result in a potential 6.6% decline. The consolidation box around $1,193 represents the base from which the recent advance developed, with a relatively balanced risk-reward ratio suggesting a current equilibrium between buyers and sellers. To take it even further, daily chart analysis identifies three distinct phases of breakout. The first, from a $650 to $700 base, yields 27% gains, the second, from a $850 consolidation, yields 29% gains, and projections suggest the current third breakout could produce 51% gains, reaching $1,500. $BNB is repeating its perfect rhythm. First breakout gave 27% Second breakout gave 29% Now the third one is in play with a clear target near $1500, around 51% higher. The trend speaks for itself. Don’t overthink it. pic.twitter.com/66QTb8y6LI — Crypto King (@CryptoKing4Ever) October 7, 2025 However, the pattern of escalating percentage gains assumes unlimited buying power and ignores profit-taking dynamics that typically emerge after substantial advances. BNB has already delivered over 100% gains from recent bases around $600. The $1,500 target represents approximately 18.5% upside from current levels around $1,266, requiring BNB’s market capitalization to reach above $208 billion and entirely surpass XRP and USDT to solidify its position as the third-largest digital asset. The rally didn’t start overnight; BNB has recorded a price increase of over 99% in the past three months. Some analysts believe FOMO could push BNB toward $1,500 as the next psychological target, although ecosystem developments and treasury buying may already be reflected in current valuations. As it stands now, BNB could continue toward $1,400-$1,500 if momentum extends, although consolidation between $1,200-$1,350 appears more likely as markets digest recent 100%+ gains from $600 bases. A potential correction toward $1,100-$1,150 remains possible if profit-taking accelerates following the all-time high breakout, as the hourly chart’s balanced risk parameters contradict aggressive longer-term projections.

        "body": "Bitcoin traded near $124,900 this week after comments from Telegram founder Pavel Durov drew attention back to its long-term potential. Speaking on the Lex Fridman Podcast, Durov said he believes Bitcoin could eventually reach $1 million per coin, citing its fixed supply and independence from government control as key advantages. His remarks come at a time when investors are reassessing Bitcoin’s role as an alternative to inflation-prone fiat currencies. Scarcity and Early Conviction Drive Bullish Outlook Durov said he became an early Bitcoin investor in 2013, buying several thousand coins at around $700 each. Even after steep market declines — including a drop below $200 — he chose to hold, describing Bitcoin as “digital gold.” He said its appeal lies in its independence: no central authority can seize or censor it, and its supply is permanently limited to 21 million coins. This scarcity remains central to Bitcoin’s value proposition. Increasingly, institutional investors share this view, treating BTC as a hedge against monetary expansion and weakening fiat currencies. Durov’s experience illustrates that perspective. He credits his Bitcoin holdings, rather than Telegram’s profits, for giving him the freedom to operate globally and independently. This position reinforces why many see Bitcoin as more than a speculative asset. Macro Trends Support the $1 Million Thesis Durov linked his $1 million Bitcoin projection to broader economic forces, particularly the long-term effects of expansive monetary policy. He argued that as governments continue to increase money supply to manage debt and stimulate growth, assets with fixed supply — like Bitcoin — stand to benefit. “I think this is how money should work,” he said. “Nobody can confiscate your Bitcoin, and nobody can censor you for political reasons.” Here's my 4+ hour conversation with Pavel Durov ( @durov ), founder and CEO of Telegram. This was one of the most fascinating and powerful conversations I've ever had in my life. We discuss everything from his philosophy on freedom to government bureaucracies, intelligence… pic.twitter.com/DDBTnE7A2t — Lex Fridman (@lexfridman) September 30, 2025 His view aligns with a growing sentiment among investors who see Bitcoin as a safeguard against currency erosion. With inflation pressures persisting and global debt levels rising, Bitcoin’s decentralized and finite structure provides a contrast to traditional systems that rely on central banks. Market reaction to Durov’s comments has been steady. Bitcoin’s ability to hold above $124,000 reflects continued institutional demand, despite short-term volatility persisting. For many, his remarks reinforce a longer-term narrative: that Bitcoin’s value is increasingly tied to its role as a counterweight to monetary excess rather than a short-lived speculative cycle. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Bearish Butterfly Nears Reversal Zone On the technical front , Bitcoin remains firmly in an uptrend, with price action continuing to follow the rising trendline that has defined October’s advance. The structure of higher highs and higher lows points to steady accumulation, while the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages — at $114,186 and $107,586 — provide clear dynamic support beneath the market. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The chart shows a Bearish Butterfly harmonic pattern approaching its Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) between $128,000 and $130,000. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) near 73 signals mildly overbought conditions, hinting at a short-term pause or pullback before any renewed push higher. As long as Bitcoin holds above $124,600, a move toward the $130,000 area remains likely. A clean breakout beyond that range would invalidate the bearish setup and potentially open a path toward $160,000 in the medium term. #Bitcoin consolidates near $125K as the Bearish Butterfly pattern nears its reversal zone at $128K–$130K. RSI hovers near 73, signaling short-term caution but sustained strength. A breakout above $130K could invalidate the pattern and open the path toward $160K. pic.twitter.com/ID1288MTiZ — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 7, 2025 At this stage, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above key support levels suggests consolidation rather than exhaustion. Combined with growing institutional inflows and renewed market optimism following Durov’s remarks, the broader outlook for Q4 2025 remains skewed to the upside.

        "body": "Bitcoin exchange netflows are at a three-year low, with a 14-day SMA averaging roughly –7,500 BTC, signaling sustained outflows from exchanges and reduced short-term selling pressure as long-term holders accumulate and move coins into self-custody. 14-day SMA: ~–7,500 BTC outflow Outflows are the largest since the 2022–2023 cycle, showing lower exchange liquidity. Regular withdrawals and constrained exchange supply indicate accumulation by long-term holders. Bitcoin exchange netflows hit a 3-year low, averaging –7,500 BTC over 14 days; read analysis and implications for holders and market structure. What are Bitcoin exchange netflows indicating? Bitcoin exchange netflows measure coins moving into minus out of exchanges; a sustained negative netflow means more BTC is leaving exchanges than entering, signaling lower immediate sell supply and higher accumulation by holders. This typically reduces available on‑exchange liquidity and can amplify price reactions to demand shifts. How did netflows reach a 3-year bottom? On-chain tracking shows the 14-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of exchange netflows averaging about –7,500 BTC. OnChainSchool data places recent outflows at the largest volume since the 2022–2023 cycle. These figures point to consistent withdrawals rather than short-term profit taking. Bitcoin exchange netflows reach a 3-year low, showing strong holder conviction as investors move BTC off exchanges despite record prices. The average outflow of bitcoin exchange is -7,500 BTC in 14 days, and the volume of its withdrawal is the highest since the 2022-2023 cycle. The long-term confidence and the weak pressure to enter short-term sales can be interpreted by the fact that investors keep selling BTC out of exchanges despite new all-time highs. Regular outflows and constrained exchange supply show a maturity stage of the market where accumulation is taking over the speculative activity of long-term holders. Netflows of Bitcoin exchanges have dropped to a three-year low, indicating that holders are moving coins off exchanges more rapidly than they are sending them in. This trend suggests diminishing short-term selling pressure as more BTC becomes illiquid on exchanges and more remains in long-term wallets. Outflows Reach the Largest Level Since 2022–2023 On-chain data indicates the 14-day SMA of Bitcoin exchange netflows is near –7,500 BTC, reflecting the largest withdrawal volume outside the 2022–2023 cycle. The scale of withdrawals is notable for its consistency across major exchanges. Source: OnChainSchool Fewer coins being deposited to exchanges typically means less immediate liquidity for selling. Investors moving assets into self-custody wallets demonstrates a preference for holding through volatility rather than realizing gains at current all-time highs. Reduced exchange balances tighten available supply for market participants, which can magnify price sensitivity when demand changes. The netflow trend highlights a structural shift toward accumulation over speculative turnover. Investor Behavior Signals Long-Term Confidence Outflows persisted even as Bitcoin recently reached new all-time highs, showing holders are not broadly seeking to exit positions. This retention behavior underlines confidence in long-term prospects rather than short-term profit taking. OnChainSchool’s on-chain metrics show persistent withdrawals from exchanges, signaling that investors prioritize custody and long-term storage strategies. That mindset is consistent with a maturing market dominated by accumulation. Reduced Selling Pressure Reinforces Market Stability Declining netflows correspond with lower on-exchange inventories, which typically reduces immediate selling pressure. With less BTC readily available on exchanges, price moves can become less driven by speculative liquidation and more by genuine supply-demand dynamics. Institutional participation and growing long-term holder concentration further support a less volatile distribution profile, as accumulation by strong hands decreases the frequency of rapid sell-offs. Frequently Asked Questions What does a negative exchange netflow mean for Bitcoin price? A negative exchange netflow (more outflows than inflows) reduces exchange liquidity and often creates tighter supply, which can amplify price upside if demand rises. It does not guarantee price increases but lowers immediate selling capacity. How is the 14-day SMA of exchange netflows calculated? The 14-day Simple Moving Average sums daily netflow values (inflows minus outflows) over 14 days and divides by 14. This smooths short-term noise to reveal persistent trends like the current –7,500 BTC average. Why are investors withdrawing BTC despite all-time highs? Investors often withdraw at highs to secure long-term holdings in self-custody, reduce counterparty risk, and avoid short-term liquidation. This behavior reflects confidence and a preference for accumulation over trading. Key Takeaways Outflows are significant : 14-day SMA near –7,500 BTC, highest since 2022–2023. Liquidity tightens : Fewer coins on exchanges can magnify price reactions to demand. Market maturity : Consistent accumulation suggests long-term investor conviction and reduced speculative turnover. Conclusion Bitcoin exchange netflows at a three-year low point to a market dominated by accumulation and reduced short-term selling pressure. With long-term holders moving BTC into private custody, exchange supply is tighter and market dynamics are shifting toward less speculative volatility.

        "body": "Binance Coin ( BNB ) surged past $1,300 on October 6, 2025, marking its second all-time high within hours after initially breaking $1,200 earlier in the day, as the token flipped XRP to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Source: TradingVew The 19% weekly gain boosted BNB’s market cap to over $154 billion, surpassing both Tether and XRP behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. BNB Chain topped all blockchains in 24-hour fees, followed closely by Hyperledger and Solana. The rally coincided with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high above $126,000, as the ongoing US government shutdown drove investors to cryptocurrencies as safe-haven assets. Founder Changpeng Zhao emphasized ecosystem growth, with 30% of BNB’s supply now staked amid institutional inflows and the expansion of DeFi. The surge comes as October historically delivers a strong fourth-quarter performance for cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin averaging 79.6% gains in past Q4 periods. JUST IN: $BNB reaches new ATH of $1,300 pic.twitter.com/wVvWHElltX — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) October 7, 2025 CZ Admits Preferring X Over Binance Square Despite BNB Rally Amid these wild runs towards new ATHs, Changpeng Zhao admitted he personally prefers using X over Binance’s own social platform, Binance Square, despite the latter reaching 275 million users since launching in 2023. CZ cited security concerns as the primary reason, stating he likes to “ stay logged out on Binance.com when not making a transaction ” and can go months without logging in. He noted he uses X to reach the “non-Binance community” as the center of broader crypto discourse. There are a few reasons I use X more than Binance Square. I like to stay logged out on https://t.co/9rMMAmczvH when not making a transaction, as a security policy. I go on for months without logging in. I like to reach non Binance community. But maybe I will switch back there https://t.co/A2Jsltrsqb — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 4, 2025 The comments received mixed reactions, with critics questioning why the founder would not be active in his own ecosystem. The contrast with Elon Musk’s frequent posting on X since acquiring Twitter in 2022 stands out sharply. CZ concluded by saying he will “ maybe ” switch back to Binance Square in the future. Broader Market Rally Driven by Political Uncertainty and Institutional Demand Bitcoin’s surge past $126,000 was accompanied by over $1 billion in spot ETF inflows , including nearly $970 million from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, with trading volume up more than 20% from the prior day. Analysts attribute the rally to the April halving, pro-crypto policies under the Trump administration, and Bitcoin’s appeal amid the political uncertainty caused by the government shutdown. Just yesterday, Strategy Inc. reported a $3.9 billion unrealized gain on its 640,031 BTC holdings in the third quarter, with total fair value reaching $47.35 billion. Earlier today, VanEck’s Matthew Sigel stated that surveys indicate younger consumers are increasingly favoring Bitcoin for wealth preservation over gold. He noted that around half of gold’s market value comes from its store of value role, and if Bitcoin captured half of that market, it would imply $644,000 per coin at today’s record gold price. We’ve been saying Bitcoin should reach half of gold’s market cap after the next halving. Roughly half of gold’s value reflects its use as a store of value rather than industrial or jewelry demand, and surveys show younger consumers in emerging markets increasingly prefer Bitcoin… — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) October 7, 2025 VanEck projects that Bitcoin could settle 10% of global trade by 2050, supporting a long-term price of $2.9 million per coin, equivalent to a $61 trillion market capitalization. Technical Analysis Projects $1,500 Target Following Breakout Pattern Hourly chart analysis reveals BNB trading at $1,266.83 following a breakout from consolidation near $1,193, with upside targets of approximately $1,347 representing a 6.3% gain. Source: X/@Tryrexcrypto Conversely, downside risk lies below $1,183, which would result in a potential 6.6% decline. The consolidation box around $1,193 represents the base from which the recent advance developed, with a relatively balanced risk-reward ratio suggesting a current equilibrium between buyers and sellers. To take it even further, daily chart analysis identifies three distinct phases of breakout. The first, from a $650 to $700 base, yields 27% gains, the second, from a $850 consolidation, yields 29% gains, and projections suggest the current third breakout could produce 51% gains, reaching $1,500. $BNB is repeating its perfect rhythm. First breakout gave 27% Second breakout gave 29% Now the third one is in play with a clear target near $1500, around 51% higher. The trend speaks for itself. Don’t overthink it. pic.twitter.com/66QTb8y6LI — Crypto King (@CryptoKing4Ever) October 7, 2025 However, the pattern of escalating percentage gains assumes unlimited buying power and ignores profit-taking dynamics that typically emerge after substantial advances. BNB has already delivered over 100% gains from recent bases around $600. The $1,500 target represents approximately 18.5% upside from current levels around $1,266, requiring BNB’s market capitalization to reach above $208 billion and entirely surpass XRP and USDT to solidify its position as the third-largest digital asset. The rally didn’t start overnight; BNB has recorded a price increase of over 99% in the past three months. Some analysts believe FOMO could push BNB toward $1,500 as the next psychological target, although ecosystem developments and treasury buying may already be reflected in current valuations. As it stands now, BNB could continue toward $1,400-$1,500 if momentum extends, although consolidation between $1,200-$1,350 appears more likely as markets digest recent 100%+ gains from $600 bases. A potential correction toward $1,100-$1,150 remains possible if profit-taking accelerates following the all-time high breakout, as the hourly chart’s balanced risk parameters contradict aggressive longer-term projections.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/croatia-football-federation-reward-crypto/",
        "body": "The Croatian Football Federation (HNS) has launched a new loyalty program that rewards fans with cryptocurrency through its official store app, making Croatia the first national football team to embed blockchain rewards directly into its fan engagement system. HNS released a public statement on Tuesday in conjunction with blockchain company Kadena, which joined forces in February this year. The multi-year collaboration extends through major global football tournaments, including the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 UEFA Euro Cup. The new feature went live on Tuesday, just two days before Croatia’s World Cup qualifier against the Czech Republic on October 9 and ahead of its next match versus Gibraltar on October 12. According to the federation, the timing of the product’s debut is meant to increase fan enthusiasm as Croatia pushes toward qualification for the 2026 World Cup. HNS Official Store app rewards go live Under the new system, fans who make purchases through the HNS Official Store app, such as jerseys, scarves, or other merchandise, will automatically receive 1% of their spending back in VATRENI tokens. The tokens, issued on Kadena’s blockchain network, are redeemable for team merchandise and VIP experiences. Future redemption options, such as match tickets, are expected to be added later, according to the federation. Each participating fan will also have a digital wallet connected to their app account, where they can earn, receive, and store rewards without handling the technical aspects crypto requires at times. The VATRENI token was first introduced as an ERC-20 asset on the Polygon network but has since migrated to Kadena’s blockchain via the Kinesis Bridge. Kadena’s technology, known for its scalable Proof-of-Work architecture called Chainweb, boasts of providing high transaction throughput with minimal fees. The blockchain platform supports both its proprietary smart contract language, Pact, and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility that is currently in testnet, to make development accessible for mainstream applications. “The goal with the VATRENI token is to push the boundaries of traditional fan engagement and introduce a future-focused experience,” denoted Joel Woodman, Kadena’s Head of Partnerships. “We’re working with our partners to integrate new technology into the Croatian Football Federation ecosystem, including AI tools, virtual experiences, and personalized activations.” Croatia national team seeks fan engagement through digital tokens During the Kadena partnership announcement in February, HNS President Marijan Kustić said the federation is responding to how fan behavior is leaning towards cryptocurrencies. “The mission of HNS is to ensure the development of Croatian football for the future, aligned with trends not only in sports but also in society as a whole. Cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence have become part of everyday life, so we are keeping pace with that development through our VATRENI project.” The HNS Official Store app is available for download on both the Apple App Store and Google Play. Once logged in, fans can browse official merchandise and automatically receive crypto rewards for purchases without additional setup. Kadena’s system processes the blockchain transactions, so users do not need prior crypto experience to participate. The partnership also includes promotional elements such as ticket giveaways and reward pools for app users. The federation expects the initiative to increase app downloads in the coming months, with projections of hundreds of thousands of wallets being created before the next World Cup is held next year in Canada, Mexico and the United States. According to stats from ESPN, Croatia is leading Group L of the UEFA World Cup Qualifications, having won all four of their games against Montenegro, Faroe Islands, Czechia and Gibraltar. Croatia is among a small but growing number of football organizations experimenting with blockchain-based fan programs. Several European clubs have released fan tokens in recent years, although HNS is the first national team to integrate crypto rewards directly into its official commerce platform. Paris Saint-Germain’s fan token ($PSG) caught the interest of football fans during the 2024–25 season, particularly after the club won a treble including the UEFA Champions League trophy.

Cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence have become part of everyday life, so we are keeping pace with that development through our VATRENI project.” The HNS Official Store app is available for download on both the Apple App Store and Google Play. Once logged in, fans can browse official merchandise and automatically receive crypto rewards for purchases without additional setup. Kadena’s system processes the blockchain transactions, so users do not need prior crypto experience to participate. The partnership also includes promotional elements such as ticket giveaways and reward pools for app users. The federation expects the initiative to increase app downloads in the coming months, with projections of hundreds of thousands of wallets being created before the next World Cup is held next year in Canada, Mexico and the United States. According to stats from ESPN, Croatia is leading Group L of the UEFA World Cup Qualifications, having won all four of their games against Montenegro, Faroe Islands, Czechia and Gibraltar. Croatia is among a small but growing number of football organizations experimenting with blockchain-based fan programs. Several European clubs have released fan tokens in recent years, although HNS is the first national team to integrate crypto rewards directly into its official commerce platform. Paris Saint-Germain’s fan token ($PSG) caught the interest of football fans during the 2024–25 season, particularly after the club won a treble including the UEFA Champions League trophy.

Breakout Potential The tight range suggests momentum is building for a move above $4.43 toward $4.60. Rising optimism and improving market sentiment support Polkadot’s steady recovery and growing bullish outlook. As of October 7, 2025, Polkadot (DOT) is trading at $4.30, showing a 2.91% gain in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has displayed a positive momentum, recovering from its lower range and maintaining stability above the $4.20 mark. The key resistance levels are noted at $4.43, while support remains firm at $4.18, signaling a steady trading channel. DOT’s price behavior indicates renewed optimism among traders as it continues to hold within a short-term bullish zone. The recovery coincides with improving sentiment across the broader crypto market, supporting Polkadot’s upward movement. Polkadot 1-day price chart: DOT building strength above support The daily chart reveals that Polkadot is forming a gradual bullish structure as it trades above its key support at $4.18. The recent bounce toward $4.30 suggests buyers are defending lower levels effectively, showing resilience in the current market setup. DOT remains positioned near its short-term moving averages, indicating that a bullish trend is beginning to outweigh selling momentum. A clear breakout above $4.43 could validate this strength, potentially opening the path for a move toward the $4.60–$4.70 range. DOT/USDT Price Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around the neutral zone, reflecting balanced conditions with a slight bullish tilt. The MACD line indicates convergence, suggesting a potential continuation of the upward trend if volume increases.

For now, DOT’s daily trend structure suggests consolidation within a narrow range, with momentum gradually shifting in favor of buyers. Polkadot 4-hour price chart: DOT consolidation before a breakout On the 4-hour timeframe, Polkadot is consolidating tightly between $4.18 and $4.43, forming a short-term symmetrical structure that reflects indecision among traders. The price has repeatedly tested both the upper and lower bounds, confirming the significance of these levels as immediate barriers to further movement in the upcoming parachain auctions. The short-term moving averages are aligning closely, indicating that a breakout may be approaching. A confirmed close above $4.43 could lead to increased momentum, while a dip below $4.18 might trigger minor pullbacks toward $4.10. DOT/USDT Price Chart: TradingView The RSI remains mid-range, suggesting that DOT still has room to rise before becoming overbought. Trading volume has remained steady, suggesting accumulation during this consolidation phase. Traders are closely watching for a decisive move supported by substantial volume to determine the next directional shift. If bullish pressure persists, DOT could break out of its current pattern, signaling renewed upward momentum in the short term.

A breakout above the $4.43 resistance could pave the way toward $4.60 or higher, confirming renewed market confidence. However, if DOT fails to sustain above $4.25, a short-term pullback toward $4.18 remains possible before the next upward attempt. Overall, as long as DOT maintains support above $4.20, the near-term price action favors gradual gains. And a potential continuation of its recovery trend. Is Polkadot a good investment? Polkadot continues to show resilience, maintaining solid support and attracting steady investor interest. Its long-term potential lies in its strong ecosystem and innovative multichain technology, which enables seamless interoperability between blockchains. As the network expands with new parachain developments and DeFi integrations, DOT’s utility and demand are expected to grow. In the short term, DOT’s performance will depend on broader market conditions and its ability to hold above key support levels. For long-term investors, Polkadot remains a promising project with strong fundamentals, though patience and awareness of market volatility are essential. Why is Polkadot up today? Polkadot’s recent price increase can be attributed to a combination of improving market sentiment and renewed buying interest across major cryptocurrencies. The broader cryptocurrency market recovery has strengthened investor confidence, prompting accumulation near key support levels as some anticipate a new all-time high. Additionally, Polkadot’s consistent network growth and rising activity within its parachain ecosystem are reinforcing optimism among traders in the broader blockchain ecosystem. These factors, along with steady technical support above $4.20, have fueled the current bullish momentum and lifted DOT’s price toward the $4.30 range.

        "body": "Summary Active management helps investors navigate crypto’s boom-and-bust cycles by adjusting exposure as conditions change. Active strategies can capture growth dynamics across miners, fintechs, and infrastructure—not just tokens. Research-driven oversight aims to screen out weak players and seeks to avoid costly failures. Originally published on September 18, 2025 With shifting cycles, emerging opportunities, and rapid innovation, crypto is a market where adaptability matters. Active management provides the flexibility to harness upside potential while avoiding the pitfalls that passive strategies must endure. Introduction Crypto is one of the fastest-moving areas of global markets. Entire sectors can rise or fall within months, and the winners of one cycle often fade into obscurity by the next. For investors, this raises an important question: is simply buying and holding enough, or does crypto demand a more active approach? Here are three reasons why active management can make a meaningful difference in digital assets. 1. The Cycle Challenge * Crypto markets are cyclical, often moving in four-year waves tied to Bitcoin’s halving events. During bull runs, digital asset prices and related equities can soar, while bear markets bring steep corrections. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has experienced peak-to-trough drawdowns of 70% or more in past cycles, pulling down miners, exchanges, and related equities with it. Source: Morningstar. Q3 2025. Data included in chart refers to S&P 500 Total Return Index (S&P 500 TR). 60/40 Portfolio is 60% S&P 500 TR and 40% Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Bitcoin data refers to Bloomberg Bitcoin Index. Please see important disclosures and index definitions at the end of this content. Past performance and references to Bitcoin market cycles are based on historical data, neither of which guarantee future results. This chart makes clear that timing and adaptability matter: historically, while the volatility is extreme, so have been the recoveries. Even with those steep declines, Bitcoin’s historical long-term performance remains among the strongest of any asset class. The key question for investors is whether active management can help keep the upside while dialing down the pain of the downside. An active approach allows investors to adjust exposure as these cycles unfold rather than simply riding them up and down. This could mean leaning into higher-growth opportunities when conditions are favorable and becoming more cautious when signs of stress appear. The flexibility to make those shifts is one of the clearest advantages of active management in crypto. 2. Beyond Just Tokens The onchain economy is broader than just cryptocurrencies. It includes miners powering both Bitcoin and AI data centers, fintech firms enabling digital payments, exchanges providing liquidity, and even energy infrastructure companies that keep this digital ecosystem running. These are businesses with revenues, cash flows, and real customers—not just speculative tokens. One way to see this trend: companies are increasingly talking about blockchain in their regulatory disclosures. Mentions of terms related to digital assets in SEC filings climbed this past year, hitting their highest point last month. That steady rise suggests that adoption is moving beyond crypto-native firms and into a much wider range of industries. Blockchain-related Mentions in SEC Filings Source: SEC Edgar Database. The Block. As of 9/9/25. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities referenced herein or as any call to action. Active management allows rotation between these categories to balance risk and reward. For example, during the AI boom of 2024, several Bitcoin miners repurposed data centers to service high-performance computing demand—creating growth opportunities outside of pure crypto cycles. Similarly, fintech leaders in Latin America and Asia have integrated crypto wallets into their payments platforms, broadening adoption and revenue streams. These types of cross-sector opportunities highlight how diversified companies can benefit investors in ways that passive indexes tied strictly to tokens cannot. 3. Filtering Risks & Avoiding the Duds Not every company or token in the digital asset space is built to last. Some carry excessive leverage, weak governance, or business models tied to hype cycles. The past few years alone saw high-profile failures of both private and publicly traded firms that grew too aggressively and collapsed when liquidity dried up. Active management brings research discipline—screening out fragile players while identifying firms with sustainable revenues, strong balance sheets, and strategic positioning in the onchain economy. Think of it as spotting cracks in a foundation: if you see them early enough, you can step aside before the building comes down. Passive strategies, on the other hand, are stuck holding everything in the index—even as it falls apart. The public markets offer cautionary examples. Silvergate Capital ( SICPQ ), once trading above $200 a share, saw an 89% drawdown in late 2022 before announcing liquidation in March 2023 and filing for bankruptcy in 2024. Signature Bank ( SBNY ), which peaked near $375 in early 2022, was seized by regulators in March 2023 after a deposit run, with shares now worth pennies on OTC markets. And Voyager Digital ( VYGVQ ), a Canadian-listed crypto broker, lost over 99% of its value following exposure to Three Arrows Capital and filed for bankruptcy in July 2022. In each case, red flags like concentrated crypto deposits, weak liquidity, or risky lending appeared before the final collapse—warning signs that active managers could have acted on well before passive strategies were forced to ride them down.

This ability to separate signals from noise is especially valuable in crypto, where the pace of innovation is matched by the frequency of failed experiments. Active oversight also enables selective use of tools like exchange-traded products or futures, adding tactical exposure during favorable environments and reducing it when conditions deteriorate—an advantage that passive strategies lack. Conclusion For investors, we believe the case for active management in crypto is clear: it provides the ability to adapt to cycles, diversify beyond tokens, and filter for quality. Taken together, these advantages can help navigate one of the most dynamic corners of today’s markets. For those looking for a practical way to access this approach, VanEck’s Onchain Economy ETF ( NODE ) is one option designed to bring active management into the digital asset space.

An investment in the Fund involves a substantial degree of risk and is not suitable for all investors. Investors in the Fund should be willing to accept a high degree of volatility in the price of the Fund’s Shares and the possibility of significant losses. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit with a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Therefore, you should consider carefully various risks before investing in the Fund, each of which could significantly and adversely affect the value of an investment in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may be subject to risks which include, among others, risks related to investing in digital transformation companies, digital asset instruments, commodities and commodity-linked instruments, subsidiary investment, commodity regulatory (with respect to investments in the subsidiary), tax (with respect to investments in the subsidiary), gap, liquidity, derivatives, new fund, regulatory, non-diversified, small- and medium-capitalization companies, foreign securities, emerging market issuers, market, operational, active management, authorized participant concentration, no guarantee of active trading market, trading issues, fund shares trading, premium/discount risk and liquidity of fund shares, industry concentration, cash transactions, underlying investment vehicle, and affiliated investment vehicle risks, all of which may adversely affect the fund. Emerging market issuers and foreign securities may be subject to securities markets, political and economic, investment and repatriation restrictions, different rules and regulations, less publicly available financial information, foreign currency and exchange rates, operational and settlement, and corporate and securities laws risks. Small- and medium-capitalization companies may be subject to elevated risks. Digital asset instruments may be subject to risks associated with investing in digital asset exchange-traded products (“ETPs”), which include the historical extreme volatility of the digital asset and cryptocurrency market, as well as less regulation and thus fewer investor protections, as these ETPs are not investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“1940 Act”) or commodity pools for the purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”). The technology relating to digital assets, including blockchain, is new and developing and the risks associated with digital assets may not fully emerge until the technology is widely used. Digital asset technologies are used by companies to optimize their business practices, whether by using the technology within their business or operating business lines involved in the operation of the technology. The cryptographic keys necessary to transact a digital asset may be subject to theft, loss, or destruction, which could adversely affect a company’s business or operations if it were dependent on the digital asset. There may be risks posed by the lack of regulation for digital assets and any future regulatory developments could affect the viability and expansion of the use of digital assets. Commodities and commodity-linked instruments may be subject to further risks, including tax and futures contracts risk. This risk may be adversely affected by “negative roll yields” in “contango” markets. The Fund will “roll” out of one futures contract as the expiration date approaches and into another futures contract with a later expiration date. The “rolling” feature creates the potential for a significant negative effect on the Fund’s performance that is independent of the performance of the spot prices of the underlying commodity. The “spot price” of a commodity is the price of that commodity for immediate delivery, as opposed to a futures price, which represents the price for delivery on a specified date in the future. The Fund would be expected to experience negative roll yield if the futures prices tend to be greater than the spot price. A market where futures prices are generally greater than spot prices is referred to as a “contango” market. Therefore, if the futures market for a given commodity is in contango, then the value of a futures contract on that commodity would tend to decline over time (assuming the spot price remains unchanged), because the higher futures price would fall as it converges to the lower spot price by expiration. Extended period of contango may cause significant and sustained losses. Additionally, because of the frequency with which the Fund may roll futures contracts, the impact of contango on Fund performance may be greater than it would have been if the Fund rolled futures contracts less frequently. Investing involves substantial risk and high volatility, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing.

        "body": "Bitcoin traded near $124,900 this week after comments from Telegram founder Pavel Durov drew attention back to its long-term potential. Speaking on the Lex Fridman Podcast, Durov said he believes Bitcoin could eventually reach $1 million per coin, citing its fixed supply and independence from government control as key advantages. His remarks come at a time when investors are reassessing Bitcoin’s role as an alternative to inflation-prone fiat currencies. Scarcity and Early Conviction Drive Bullish Outlook Durov said he became an early Bitcoin investor in 2013, buying several thousand coins at around $700 each. Even after steep market declines — including a drop below $200 — he chose to hold, describing Bitcoin as “digital gold.” He said its appeal lies in its independence: no central authority can seize or censor it, and its supply is permanently limited to 21 million coins. This scarcity remains central to Bitcoin’s value proposition. Increasingly, institutional investors share this view, treating BTC as a hedge against monetary expansion and weakening fiat currencies. Durov’s experience illustrates that perspective. He credits his Bitcoin holdings, rather than Telegram’s profits, for giving him the freedom to operate globally and independently. This position reinforces why many see Bitcoin as more than a speculative asset. Macro Trends Support the $1 Million Thesis Durov linked his $1 million Bitcoin projection to broader economic forces, particularly the long-term effects of expansive monetary policy. He argued that as governments continue to increase money supply to manage debt and stimulate growth, assets with fixed supply — like Bitcoin — stand to benefit. “I think this is how money should work,” he said. “Nobody can confiscate your Bitcoin, and nobody can censor you for political reasons.” Here's my 4+ hour conversation with Pavel Durov ( @durov ), founder and CEO of Telegram. This was one of the most fascinating and powerful conversations I've ever had in my life. We discuss everything from his philosophy on freedom to government bureaucracies, intelligence… pic.twitter.com/DDBTnE7A2t — Lex Fridman (@lexfridman) September 30, 2025 His view aligns with a growing sentiment among investors who see Bitcoin as a safeguard against currency erosion. With inflation pressures persisting and global debt levels rising, Bitcoin’s decentralized and finite structure provides a contrast to traditional systems that rely on central banks. Market reaction to Durov’s comments has been steady. Bitcoin’s ability to hold above $124,000 reflects continued institutional demand, despite short-term volatility persisting. For many, his remarks reinforce a longer-term narrative: that Bitcoin’s value is increasingly tied to its role as a counterweight to monetary excess rather than a short-lived speculative cycle. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Bearish Butterfly Nears Reversal Zone On the technical front , Bitcoin remains firmly in an uptrend, with price action continuing to follow the rising trendline that has defined October’s advance. The structure of higher highs and higher lows points to steady accumulation, while the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages — at $114,186 and $107,586 — provide clear dynamic support beneath the market. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The chart shows a Bearish Butterfly harmonic pattern approaching its Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) between $128,000 and $130,000. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) near 73 signals mildly overbought conditions, hinting at a short-term pause or pullback before any renewed push higher. As long as Bitcoin holds above $124,600, a move toward the $130,000 area remains likely. A clean breakout beyond that range would invalidate the bearish setup and potentially open a path toward $160,000 in the medium term. #Bitcoin consolidates near $125K as the Bearish Butterfly pattern nears its reversal zone at $128K–$130K. RSI hovers near 73, signaling short-term caution but sustained strength. A breakout above $130K could invalidate the pattern and open the path toward $160K. pic.twitter.com/ID1288MTiZ — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 7, 2025 At this stage, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above key support levels suggests consolidation rather than exhaustion. Combined with growing institutional inflows and renewed market optimism following Durov’s remarks, the broader outlook for Q4 2025 remains skewed to the upside.

        "body": "Binance Coin ( BNB ) surged past $1,300 on October 6, 2025, marking its second all-time high within hours after initially breaking $1,200 earlier in the day, as the token flipped XRP to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Source: TradingVew The 19% weekly gain boosted BNB’s market cap to over $154 billion, surpassing both Tether and XRP behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. BNB Chain topped all blockchains in 24-hour fees, followed closely by Hyperledger and Solana. The rally coincided with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high above $126,000, as the ongoing US government shutdown drove investors to cryptocurrencies as safe-haven assets. Founder Changpeng Zhao emphasized ecosystem growth, with 30% of BNB’s supply now staked amid institutional inflows and the expansion of DeFi. The surge comes as October historically delivers a strong fourth-quarter performance for cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin averaging 79.6% gains in past Q4 periods. JUST IN: $BNB reaches new ATH of $1,300 pic.twitter.com/wVvWHElltX — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) October 7, 2025 CZ Admits Preferring X Over Binance Square Despite BNB Rally Amid these wild runs towards new ATHs, Changpeng Zhao admitted he personally prefers using X over Binance’s own social platform, Binance Square, despite the latter reaching 275 million users since launching in 2023. CZ cited security concerns as the primary reason, stating he likes to “ stay logged out on Binance.com when not making a transaction ” and can go months without logging in. He noted he uses X to reach the “non-Binance community” as the center of broader crypto discourse. There are a few reasons I use X more than Binance Square. I like to stay logged out on https://t.co/9rMMAmczvH when not making a transaction, as a security policy. I go on for months without logging in. I like to reach non Binance community. But maybe I will switch back there https://t.co/A2Jsltrsqb — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 4, 2025 The comments received mixed reactions, with critics questioning why the founder would not be active in his own ecosystem. The contrast with Elon Musk’s frequent posting on X since acquiring Twitter in 2022 stands out sharply. CZ concluded by saying he will “ maybe ” switch back to Binance Square in the future. Broader Market Rally Driven by Political Uncertainty and Institutional Demand Bitcoin’s surge past $126,000 was accompanied by over $1 billion in spot ETF inflows , including nearly $970 million from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, with trading volume up more than 20% from the prior day. Analysts attribute the rally to the April halving, pro-crypto policies under the Trump administration, and Bitcoin’s appeal amid the political uncertainty caused by the government shutdown. Just yesterday, Strategy Inc. reported a $3.9 billion unrealized gain on its 640,031 BTC holdings in the third quarter, with total fair value reaching $47.35 billion. Earlier today, VanEck’s Matthew Sigel stated that surveys indicate younger consumers are increasingly favoring Bitcoin for wealth preservation over gold. He noted that around half of gold’s market value comes from its store of value role, and if Bitcoin captured half of that market, it would imply $644,000 per coin at today’s record gold price. We’ve been saying Bitcoin should reach half of gold’s market cap after the next halving. Roughly half of gold’s value reflects its use as a store of value rather than industrial or jewelry demand, and surveys show younger consumers in emerging markets increasingly prefer Bitcoin… — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) October 7, 2025 VanEck projects that Bitcoin could settle 10% of global trade by 2050, supporting a long-term price of $2.9 million per coin, equivalent to a $61 trillion market capitalization. Technical Analysis Projects $1,500 Target Following Breakout Pattern Hourly chart analysis reveals BNB trading at $1,266.83 following a breakout from consolidation near $1,193, with upside targets of approximately $1,347 representing a 6.3% gain. Source: X/@Tryrexcrypto Conversely, downside risk lies below $1,183, which would result in a potential 6.6% decline. The consolidation box around $1,193 represents the base from which the recent advance developed, with a relatively balanced risk-reward ratio suggesting a current equilibrium between buyers and sellers. To take it even further, daily chart analysis identifies three distinct phases of breakout. The first, from a $650 to $700 base, yields 27% gains, the second, from a $850 consolidation, yields 29% gains, and projections suggest the current third breakout could produce 51% gains, reaching $1,500. $BNB is repeating its perfect rhythm. First breakout gave 27% Second breakout gave 29% Now the third one is in play with a clear target near $1500, around 51% higher. The trend speaks for itself. Don’t overthink it. pic.twitter.com/66QTb8y6LI — Crypto King (@CryptoKing4Ever) October 7, 2025 However, the pattern of escalating percentage gains assumes unlimited buying power and ignores profit-taking dynamics that typically emerge after substantial advances. BNB has already delivered over 100% gains from recent bases around $600. The $1,500 target represents approximately 18.5% upside from current levels around $1,266, requiring BNB’s market capitalization to reach above $208 billion and entirely surpass XRP and USDT to solidify its position as the third-largest digital asset. The rally didn’t start overnight; BNB has recorded a price increase of over 99% in the past three months. Some analysts believe FOMO could push BNB toward $1,500 as the next psychological target, although ecosystem developments and treasury buying may already be reflected in current valuations. As it stands now, BNB could continue toward $1,400-$1,500 if momentum extends, although consolidation between $1,200-$1,350 appears more likely as markets digest recent 100%+ gains from $600 bases. A potential correction toward $1,100-$1,150 remains possible if profit-taking accelerates following the all-time high breakout, as the hourly chart’s balanced risk parameters contradict aggressive longer-term projections.

        "url": "https://timestabloid.com/elliott-wave-analyst-xrp-is-about-to-teleport-to-6-9-heres-why/",
        "body": "In financial markets, the quiet before a breakout often conceals the most powerful moves. XRP now appears to be in that calm — a tightening range that’s preparing to erupt. After weeks of compressed trading and capped volatility, the cryptocurrency is positioned at a critical juncture. According to Elliott Wave analyst Hov, XRP could be on the verge of initiating one of its strongest upward impulses yet — a move that could swiftly carry it toward $6.90 if key technical conditions align. XRP’s Market Structure and Current Performance As of report time, XRP trades around $2.97, holding steady despite a broadly consolidating crypto market. The token’s recent price action has been characterized by higher lows and diminishing downside pressure, suggesting sustained accumulation beneath the surface. With Bitcoin hovering above $124,000, risk appetite across digital assets is recovering, providing a constructive backdrop for potential continuation in XRP. $XRP about to teleport to $6.9 Since our last XRP update it's been coiling up while capping downside to nothing more than wicks (threaded) We're right on the edge of confirming our wave 3 of 3 here Key will be getting a HTF close above 3.25ish Once that happens I believe… pic.twitter.com/KkfNrykKmV — Hov (@HovWaves) October 6, 2025 Traders observing the daily chart have noted that XRP’s structure has been coiling within a tight range between the high-$2 zone and the low-$3 area. Each minor dip has been met with renewed buying, reinforcing a sense of latent strength. This accumulation phase, according to Hov, is the necessary prelude to the next major impulsive leg. Inside Hov’s Elliott Wave Thesis In his latest X post, Hov describes XRP’s current setup as the prelude to a “wave 3 of 3” formation — the most explosive stage in Elliott Wave theory, known for producing steep and sustained rallies. He identifies the $3.25 region as the decisive barrier that must be broken and held on a high-timeframe (HTF) close for the next wave to be confirmed. Once that condition is met, the technical model projects an accelerated climb toward $6.90, aligning with Fibonacci extension targets often seen in major third-wave expansions. Hov’s analysis highlights that the asset has held firm through its consolidation range, even maintaining strength above earlier structural zones that previously acted as deeper support. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Technical Road to $6.90 Hov’s projection is grounded in clear market logic. A confirmed breakout above $3.25 would signify the transition from compression to expansion, validating bullish control. Historically, when assets break from such tightly wound structures in a confirmed wave three, momentum often compounds quickly as both traders and algorithms recognize the shift. The target of $6.90 stems from Fibonacci wave measurements that quantify potential extensions based on earlier impulse lengths. Within this framework, a rapid price acceleration is not speculative — it’s mathematically consistent with prior patterns observed in XRP and other assets undergoing third-wave expansions. Balancing Momentum with Market Caution While the technical outlook is bullish, Hov maintains a measured perspective. Failure to achieve a sustained break above $3.25 could keep XRP trapped in its sideways pattern a while longer. Broader macroeconomic factors and liquidity trends also play a role; shifts in investor sentiment or unexpected regulatory commentary could either accelerate or delay the breakout phase. Ripple’s completed legal battle with the U.S. SEC has reduced structural risk and improved investor confidence, allowing XRP to trade with a more stable footing. That stability provides the foundation for a possible resurgence once the market confirms direction. XRP’s chart is at a moment of equilibrium — pressure building, structure tightening, and momentum waiting to ignite. Hov’s Elliott Wave projection provides a clear technical roadmap: a decisive close above $3.25 could trigger a powerful surge toward $6.90, while failure to confirm the breakout may prolong consolidation. For now, XRP’s resilience and technical precision suggest that the next major move may not be far away. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

        "body": "Meanwhile, the first regulated life insurance company that operates entirely in bitcoin (BTC), said on Tuesday it has raised $82 million to scale its savings and retirement products that aim to protect against inflation and currency devaluation. The funding round was co-led by Bain Capital Crypto and Haun Ventures, with participation from Pantera Capital, Apollo, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures and Stillmark, the firm shared in a press release with CoinDesk. The raise follows a $40 million round in April led by Fulgur Ventures and Framework, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was an early investor. Founded in Bermuda, Meanwhile offers life insurance and annuity products denominated in BTC, allowing policyholders to save and transfer wealth in an asset with a fixed supply. The service aims to guard customers against inflation and currency devaluation over time, but policyholders also take on bitcoin’s price volatility. Its products are regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority and designed to mirror traditional long-term financial tools, but in BTC. The company earns returns on held bitcoin through long-term lending to private credit markets, helping it meet claims obligations and maintain solvency standards similar to legacy insurers. \"Life insurers have always provided the steady, long-term capital that keeps financial markets moving,\" Zac Townsend, CEO of Meanwhile, said in a statement. \"We’re bringing that same role to Bitcoin — helping families save and protect wealth in BTC, while giving institutions new ways to earn returns and launch bitcoin-indexed products that are compliant and easy to scale.\" Meanwhile’s approach has found traction among both individuals and institutions, underscoring a surge in interest from customers seeking alternatives to dollar-based insurance and treasury products, the firm said. The company said its bitcoin assets under management has grown over 200% this year, outpacing bitcoin's 34% year-to date run to record highs. \"At Haun Ventures, our thesis is that the Bitcoin economy needs more than trading platforms and DATs — it needs the core building blocks of capital markets,\" said Chris Ahn, partner at Haun Ventures, in a statement. \"Just as the U.S. economy was built on insurance, pensions, and mortgages, the Bitcoin economy will require its own long-duration financial products.\" The firm said the new capital will be used to partner with traditional insurers, grow internationally and develop new bitcoin-linked retirement tools that meet regulatory standards.",

        "body": "Bitcoin traded near $124,900 this week after comments from Telegram founder Pavel Durov drew attention back to its long-term potential. Speaking on the Lex Fridman Podcast, Durov said he believes Bitcoin could eventually reach $1 million per coin, citing its fixed supply and independence from government control as key advantages. His remarks come at a time when investors are reassessing Bitcoin’s role as an alternative to inflation-prone fiat currencies. Scarcity and Early Conviction Drive Bullish Outlook Durov said he became an early Bitcoin investor in 2013, buying several thousand coins at around $700 each. Even after steep market declines — including a drop below $200 — he chose to hold, describing Bitcoin as “digital gold.” He said its appeal lies in its independence: no central authority can seize or censor it, and its supply is permanently limited to 21 million coins. This scarcity remains central to Bitcoin’s value proposition. Increasingly, institutional investors share this view, treating BTC as a hedge against monetary expansion and weakening fiat currencies. Durov’s experience illustrates that perspective. He credits his Bitcoin holdings, rather than Telegram’s profits, for giving him the freedom to operate globally and independently. This position reinforces why many see Bitcoin as more than a speculative asset. Macro Trends Support the $1 Million Thesis Durov linked his $1 million Bitcoin projection to broader economic forces, particularly the long-term effects of expansive monetary policy. He argued that as governments continue to increase money supply to manage debt and stimulate growth, assets with fixed supply — like Bitcoin — stand to benefit. “I think this is how money should work,” he said. “Nobody can confiscate your Bitcoin, and nobody can censor you for political reasons.” Here's my 4+ hour conversation with Pavel Durov ( @durov ), founder and CEO of Telegram. This was one of the most fascinating and powerful conversations I've ever had in my life. We discuss everything from his philosophy on freedom to government bureaucracies, intelligence… pic.twitter.com/DDBTnE7A2t — Lex Fridman (@lexfridman) September 30, 2025 His view aligns with a growing sentiment among investors who see Bitcoin as a safeguard against currency erosion. With inflation pressures persisting and global debt levels rising, Bitcoin’s decentralized and finite structure provides a contrast to traditional systems that rely on central banks. Market reaction to Durov’s comments has been steady. Bitcoin’s ability to hold above $124,000 reflects continued institutional demand, despite short-term volatility persisting. For many, his remarks reinforce a longer-term narrative: that Bitcoin’s value is increasingly tied to its role as a counterweight to monetary excess rather than a short-lived speculative cycle. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Bearish Butterfly Nears Reversal Zone On the technical front , Bitcoin remains firmly in an uptrend, with price action continuing to follow the rising trendline that has defined October’s advance. The structure of higher highs and higher lows points to steady accumulation, while the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages — at $114,186 and $107,586 — provide clear dynamic support beneath the market. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The chart shows a Bearish Butterfly harmonic pattern approaching its Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) between $128,000 and $130,000. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) near 73 signals mildly overbought conditions, hinting at a short-term pause or pullback before any renewed push higher. As long as Bitcoin holds above $124,600, a move toward the $130,000 area remains likely. A clean breakout beyond that range would invalidate the bearish setup and potentially open a path toward $160,000 in the medium term. #Bitcoin consolidates near $125K as the Bearish Butterfly pattern nears its reversal zone at $128K–$130K. RSI hovers near 73, signaling short-term caution but sustained strength. A breakout above $130K could invalidate the pattern and open the path toward $160K. pic.twitter.com/ID1288MTiZ — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 7, 2025 At this stage, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above key support levels suggests consolidation rather than exhaustion. Combined with growing institutional inflows and renewed market optimism following Durov’s remarks, the broader outlook for Q4 2025 remains skewed to the upside.

        "body": "Dubai, UAE, October 7th, 2025, Chainwire Pepeto , an Ethereum-based meme coin project, has raised over $6.93 million during its ongoing presale. The token is currently offered at a fixed presale price of $0.000000157, with a total supply of 420 trillion—mirroring PEPE’s tokenomics. As part of its early-stage development, Pepeto has launched a demo version of its decentralized exchange, PepetoSwap, and is building a cross-chain bridge to support liquidity and interoperability. The project also offers staking at a 222% APY, aimed at rewarding participants during the presale phase. BNB Market Update: $1,244 Price, $173B Market Cap, and Q4 Outlook BNB is trading at $1,244.17 with a market capitalization of $173.17 billion, continuing an upward trend after breaking out of a flag pattern and retesting the $1,000 level as support. Analysts highlight consolidation near the $1,200 mark, with identified technical levels between $1,300 and $1,350. Market attention remains focused on the ongoing competition between Binance and Coinbase as Q4 unfolds. Ethereum ATH Metrics and BNB Scarcity Consideration Ethereum (ETH), created by Vitalik Buterin, is currently priced at $4,714.63 and nearing its previous all-time high of $4,900. On a return basis, ETH offers limited room for short-term gains at current levels. In contrast, a token such as BNB, if priced against ETH’s historical highs, would mathematically reflect a higher return multiple due to its current market price. BNB’s circulating supply of approximately 139.18 million is often cited in discussions around long-term scarcity. Meme Coin Market Overview: PEPE, SHIB, and DOGE PEPE is trading at $0.00001020, with a prior ATH of $0.00002479. SHIB stands at $0.00001282, close to its peak of $0.00001283. DOGE is priced at $0.2667, with a previous high near $0.57. These tokens each exhibit distinct market trajectories and historical volatility profiles. Community Commentary and Project Narrative Online discussions around Pepeto have drawn comparisons to PEPE, with some community members referencing a reported shift in direction by a former contributor associated with the original “TO” (Technology and Optimization) concept.

Breakout Potential The tight range suggests momentum is building for a move above $4.43 toward $4.60. Rising optimism and improving market sentiment support Polkadot’s steady recovery and growing bullish outlook. As of October 7, 2025, Polkadot (DOT) is trading at $4.30, showing a 2.91% gain in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has displayed a positive momentum, recovering from its lower range and maintaining stability above the $4.20 mark.

Polkadot 1-day price chart: DOT building strength above support The daily chart reveals that Polkadot is forming a gradual bullish structure as it trades above its key support at $4.18. The recent bounce toward $4.30 suggests buyers are defending lower levels effectively, showing resilience in the current market setup.

A confirmed close above $4.43 could lead to increased momentum, while a dip below $4.18 might trigger minor pullbacks toward $4.10. DOT/USDT Price Chart: TradingView The RSI remains mid-range, suggesting that DOT still has room to rise before becoming overbought.

Traders are closely watching for a decisive move supported by substantial volume to determine the next directional shift. If bullish pressure persists, DOT could break out of its current pattern, signaling renewed upward momentum in the short term.

Polkadot’s recent price increase can be attributed to a combination of improving market sentiment and renewed buying interest across major cryptocurrencies. The broader cryptocurrency market recovery has strengthened investor confidence, prompting accumulation near key support levels as some anticipate a new all-time high. Additionally, Polkadot’s consistent network growth and rising activity within its parachain ecosystem are reinforcing optimism among traders in the broader blockchain ecosystem.

        "title": "Croatia football federation flashes crypto rewards for fans using its official store app",
        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/croatia-football-federation-reward-crypto/",
        "body": "The Croatian Football Federation (HNS) has launched a new loyalty program that rewards fans with cryptocurrency through its official store app, making Croatia the first national football team to embed blockchain rewards directly into its fan engagement system. HNS released a public statement on Tuesday in conjunction with blockchain company Kadena, which joined forces in February this year. The multi-year collaboration extends through major global football tournaments, including the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 UEFA Euro Cup. The new feature went live on Tuesday, just two days before Croatia’s World Cup qualifier against the Czech Republic on October 9 and ahead of its next match versus Gibraltar on October 12. According to the federation, the timing of the product’s debut is meant to increase fan enthusiasm as Croatia pushes toward qualification for the 2026 World Cup. HNS Official Store app rewards go live Under the new system, fans who make purchases through the HNS Official Store app, such as jerseys, scarves, or other merchandise, will automatically receive 1% of their spending back in VATRENI tokens. The tokens, issued on Kadena’s blockchain network, are redeemable for team merchandise and VIP experiences. Future redemption options, such as match tickets, are expected to be added later, according to the federation. Each participating fan will also have a digital wallet connected to their app account, where they can earn, receive, and store rewards without handling the technical aspects crypto requires at times. The VATRENI token was first introduced as an ERC-20 asset on the Polygon network but has since migrated to Kadena’s blockchain via the Kinesis Bridge. Kadena’s technology, known for its scalable Proof-of-Work architecture called Chainweb, boasts of providing high transaction throughput with minimal fees. The blockchain platform supports both its proprietary smart contract language, Pact, and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility that is currently in testnet, to make development accessible for mainstream applications. “The goal with the VATRENI token is to push the boundaries of traditional fan engagement and introduce a future-focused experience,” denoted Joel Woodman, Kadena’s Head of Partnerships. “We’re working with our partners to integrate new technology into the Croatian Football Federation ecosystem, including AI tools, virtual experiences, and personalized activations.” Croatia national team seeks fan engagement through digital tokens During the Kadena partnership announcement in February, HNS President Marijan Kustić said the federation is responding to how fan behavior is leaning towards cryptocurrencies. “The mission of HNS is to ensure the development of Croatian football for the future, aligned with trends not only in sports but also in society as a whole. Cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence have become part of everyday life, so we are keeping pace with that development through our VATRENI project.” The HNS Official Store app is available for download on both the Apple App Store and Google Play. Once logged in, fans can browse official merchandise and automatically receive crypto rewards for purchases without additional setup. Kadena’s system processes the blockchain transactions, so users do not need prior crypto experience to participate. The partnership also includes promotional elements such as ticket giveaways and reward pools for app users. The federation expects the initiative to increase app downloads in the coming months, with projections of hundreds of thousands of wallets being created before the next World Cup is held next year in Canada, Mexico and the United States. According to stats from ESPN, Croatia is leading Group L of the UEFA World Cup Qualifications, having won all four of their games against Montenegro, Faroe Islands, Czechia and Gibraltar. Croatia is among a small but growing number of football organizations experimenting with blockchain-based fan programs. Several European clubs have released fan tokens in recent years, although HNS is the first national team to integrate crypto rewards directly into its official commerce platform. Paris Saint-Germain’s fan token ($PSG) caught the interest of football fans during the 2024–25 season, particularly after the club won a treble including the UEFA Champions League trophy.

        "body": "In financial markets, the quiet before a breakout often conceals the most powerful moves. XRP now appears to be in that calm — a tightening range that’s preparing to erupt. After weeks of compressed trading and capped volatility, the cryptocurrency is positioned at a critical juncture. According to Elliott Wave analyst Hov, XRP could be on the verge of initiating one of its strongest upward impulses yet — a move that could swiftly carry it toward $6.90 if key technical conditions align. XRP’s Market Structure and Current Performance As of report time, XRP trades around $2.97, holding steady despite a broadly consolidating crypto market. The token’s recent price action has been characterized by higher lows and diminishing downside pressure, suggesting sustained accumulation beneath the surface. With Bitcoin hovering above $124,000, risk appetite across digital assets is recovering, providing a constructive backdrop for potential continuation in XRP. $XRP about to teleport to $6.9 Since our last XRP update it's been coiling up while capping downside to nothing more than wicks (threaded) We're right on the edge of confirming our wave 3 of 3 here Key will be getting a HTF close above 3.25ish Once that happens I believe… pic.twitter.com/KkfNrykKmV — Hov (@HovWaves) October 6, 2025 Traders observing the daily chart have noted that XRP’s structure has been coiling within a tight range between the high-$2 zone and the low-$3 area. Each minor dip has been met with renewed buying, reinforcing a sense of latent strength. This accumulation phase, according to Hov, is the necessary prelude to the next major impulsive leg. Inside Hov’s Elliott Wave Thesis In his latest X post, Hov describes XRP’s current setup as the prelude to a “wave 3 of 3” formation — the most explosive stage in Elliott Wave theory, known for producing steep and sustained rallies. He identifies the $3.25 region as the decisive barrier that must be broken and held on a high-timeframe (HTF) close for the next wave to be confirmed. Once that condition is met, the technical model projects an accelerated climb toward $6.90, aligning with Fibonacci extension targets often seen in major third-wave expansions. Hov’s analysis highlights that the asset has held firm through its consolidation range, even maintaining strength above earlier structural zones that previously acted as deeper support. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Technical Road to $6.90 Hov’s projection is grounded in clear market logic. A confirmed breakout above $3.25 would signify the transition from compression to expansion, validating bullish control. Historically, when assets break from such tightly wound structures in a confirmed wave three, momentum often compounds quickly as both traders and algorithms recognize the shift. The target of $6.90 stems from Fibonacci wave measurements that quantify potential extensions based on earlier impulse lengths. Within this framework, a rapid price acceleration is not speculative — it’s mathematically consistent with prior patterns observed in XRP and other assets undergoing third-wave expansions. Balancing Momentum with Market Caution While the technical outlook is bullish, Hov maintains a measured perspective. Failure to achieve a sustained break above $3.25 could keep XRP trapped in its sideways pattern a while longer. Broader macroeconomic factors and liquidity trends also play a role; shifts in investor sentiment or unexpected regulatory commentary could either accelerate or delay the breakout phase. Ripple’s completed legal battle with the U.S. SEC has reduced structural risk and improved investor confidence, allowing XRP to trade with a more stable footing. That stability provides the foundation for a possible resurgence once the market confirms direction. XRP’s chart is at a moment of equilibrium — pressure building, structure tightening, and momentum waiting to ignite. Hov’s Elliott Wave projection provides a clear technical roadmap: a decisive close above $3.25 could trigger a powerful surge toward $6.90, while failure to confirm the breakout may prolong consolidation. For now, XRP’s resilience and technical precision suggest that the next major move may not be far away. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

        "body": "Dubai, UAE, October 7th, 2025, Chainwire Pepeto , an Ethereum-based meme coin project, has raised over $6.93 million during its ongoing presale. The token is currently offered at a fixed presale price of $0.000000157, with a total supply of 420 trillion—mirroring PEPE’s tokenomics. As part of its early-stage development, Pepeto has launched a demo version of its decentralized exchange, PepetoSwap, and is building a cross-chain bridge to support liquidity and interoperability. The project also offers staking at a 222% APY, aimed at rewarding participants during the presale phase. BNB Market Update: $1,244 Price, $173B Market Cap, and Q4 Outlook BNB is trading at $1,244.17 with a market capitalization of $173.17 billion, continuing an upward trend after breaking out of a flag pattern and retesting the $1,000 level as support. Analysts highlight consolidation near the $1,200 mark, with identified technical levels between $1,300 and $1,350. Market attention remains focused on the ongoing competition between Binance and Coinbase as Q4 unfolds. Ethereum ATH Metrics and BNB Scarcity Consideration Ethereum (ETH), created by Vitalik Buterin, is currently priced at $4,714.63 and nearing its previous all-time high of $4,900. On a return basis, ETH offers limited room for short-term gains at current levels. In contrast, a token such as BNB, if priced against ETH’s historical highs, would mathematically reflect a higher return multiple due to its current market price. BNB’s circulating supply of approximately 139.18 million is often cited in discussions around long-term scarcity. Meme Coin Market Overview: PEPE, SHIB, and DOGE PEPE is trading at $0.00001020, with a prior ATH of $0.00002479. SHIB stands at $0.00001282, close to its peak of $0.00001283. DOGE is priced at $0.2667, with a previous high near $0.57. These tokens each exhibit distinct market trajectories and historical volatility profiles. Community Commentary and Project Narrative Online discussions around Pepeto have drawn comparisons to PEPE, with some community members referencing a reported shift in direction by a former contributor associated with the original “TO” (Technology and Optimization) concept. While such claims remain unverified, the Pepeto project has received attention for launching products during the presale and pursuing infrastructure development. Pepeto Project Highlights PepetoSwap Demo Exchange : Live during the presale, enabling early access to the platform’s trading interface. Cross-Chain Bridge : Under development to support liquidity across blockchain ecosystems. Staking Rewards : 222% APY designed to incentivize presale participants.

        "body": "Summary Strategy has engineered a unique yield curve using preferred securities to finance aggressive Bitcoin accumulation at potentially declining costs. STRC, the variable-rate preferred, acts as a 'base money' instrument, allowing MSTR to mimic central bank functions for Bitcoin reserves. Recent policy changes and rate adjustments on STRC demonstrate MSTR's commitment to optimizing capital and defending its preferred share peg. With Bitcoin's outlook strong and MSTR's financing costs likely to fall, I remain bullish on MSTR and continue to hold a long position via put options. Last month, I outlined how Strategy ( MSTR ) has constructed a profound yield curve through its preferred securities ( STRK ), ( STRF ), ( STRD ), as well as the variable-rate ( STRC ) to finance Bitcoin acquisitions at (potentially, especially in today's falling-rates environment) declining blended costs. I also highlighted the company's initial issuance guidelines, including minimal common stock sales when market NAV (mNAV) dips below 2.5×, controlled issuance between 2.5× and 4×, and aggressive expansion above 4×, and how shortly after, the company amended its 8-K on August 18 , granting latitude for opportunistic common issuance even below 2.5× mNAV. In the weeks since, it has been quickly executing on this by raising hundreds of millions of dollars via its common ATM. Far from a reversal, however, I saw this as a commitment to real-time optimization of its capital engine. The Curve That Fuels Bitcoin Today, I want to expand on the yield curve that Strategy has constructed, and more specifically, the incredible role of STRC, which, along with the fact that the company now has the largest corporate Bitcoin treasury (640,031 coins), in some sense, makes it like Bitcoin's central bank. Strategy — Bitcoin Holdings Over Time (bitcointreasuries.net) Now, at this point, I should mention that everything I am about to discuss hinges on two key points. Firstly, you have to believe in Bitcoin for it to make sense. Secondly, at the end of the day, Strategy is running an unprecedented financial experiment. I will challenge this thesis in a minute, but for now, try to keep an open mind and do not be quick to judge the company as a pyramid scheme. Many others, including myself, here on Seeking Alpha, have already explained why that is not the case. So, Strategy's capital stack, in some sense, functions as a series of conduits, \"distilling\" (Saylor's words) fiat into Bitcoin with varying risk-reward profiles. As a reminder, STRK has a high yield with embedded upside via conversion rights. STRF, as the senior fixed-rate preferred, has an even higher yield and appeals to conservative capital seeking priority claims. STRD, the junior fixed-rate/junk variant, essentially artificially enhances STRF's safety profile. And STRC, the variable-rate, short-duration preferred, targets stability around its $100 par value, adjustable by the board to maintain that peg. MSTR's Yield Curve (Q2 Investor Presentation) Every week, Strategy is tapping the pipe that is more accretive on a common per-share basis, along with common issuances, which are accretive in the first place since it is trading above a market net asset value (mNAV) of 1.00. Now, the magic lies at STRC, as it is at the heart of this architecture, revealing Strategy's evolution into a functional analog of a central bank for Bitcoin. With a stated value of $100 and a monthly dividend rate adjustable to anchor its trading price near par, STRC operates as a base money equivalent. We saw this adjustment taking place last week for the first time following the preferred's initial payout, with management lifting the annualized rate by 25 basis points to 10.25% for October. This was a deliberate policy shift to defend the peg, accompanied by a cash dividend of $0.854166667 per share payable October 31, and it's safe to say that the market started to get the whole thing, as STRC indeed crawled quickly after toward the $100 checkpoint. STRC's Share Price (Seeking Alpha) This mechanism looks like that of central banking tools, as issuing STRC at par expands supply, channeling proceeds into Bitcoin reserves while the rate dial maintains stability. If the price goes The analogy extends further if you basically treat STRC as base money, Bitcoin as reserves, monthly rate settings as policy announcements, and transmission via yield adjustments that attract short-end demand, thus \"recycling\" fiat into reserves. Of course, unlike the Fed's Treasury purchases, Strategy buys BTC, but the whole \"leveraging policy in order to regulate and expand\" plan is a close one. And note that the August pivot to allow sub-2.5× issuance of common stock further supports this case, as it makes sure there is BTC accumulation continuity during compression (as long as it's still above 1.0x NAV), so MSTR can, in some sense, act like a lender of last resort. An Example Of STRC As A Policy Lever To illustrate this concept more effectively, imagine a future where Strategy's policy rate on STRC dips to around 3% in a low-rate environment, where the short-term government yield hovers close to 2% and STRC carries a 100 bps premium (which could be fair given the overcollateralization). This short-end compression would cascade through the yield curve, much like how Federal Reserve cuts influence Treasury bonds, encouraging investors to flock to higher fixed coupons like that of STRF's. As demand surges for STRF, it could trade substantially above par, driving its yield to maturity down to 6%, 5%, or even 4% as buyers chase safe high-yield opportunities (and STRF is overcollateralized). And in case you think that buying a 4% yield on a perpetual instrument is sort of weird, let me remind you that around this time in 2020, Austria issued a 100-year bond with a 0.85% yield (if you want to check it, the ISIN code is AT0000A2HLC4, and it matures in 2120), and institutions bought it. Far from a mere side effect, this could even enable Strategy to call its existing instruments (as per the redemption terms) and reissue new long-dated preferreds at these suppressed rates, locking in super-cheap financing potentially below 5% to fuel aggressive Bitcoin accumulation. This all makes sense in a world where Mr. Saylor sees Bitcoin delivering 29% CAGR over the next 21 years. The Yes... But Argument Now, I know that my argument might seem a bit far-out since there is no legal tender mandate, no discount window, and no reserve ratio, and the peg relies on soft tools, such as rates, issuance, and redemptions, which are vulnerable in severe drawdowns. As I have said before, if Bitcoin craters and mNAV nears 1.0×, choices harden as MSTR might have to sell reserves, issue equity below book (diluting BTC/share), or spike rates (elevating costs), all of which could erode its whole point of existence. The macro image bolsters this framework. Gold surged toward $3,900/oz due to anticipation of rate cuts and fiscal/monetary/geopolitical uncertainty, signaling a flight from the relentless fiat debasement that has become a key part of our lives. In the meantime, as I write this on Friday afternoon, Bitcoin is also set to hit a new all-time high, and hopefully, this will encourage more people, a new batch of investors, to research Bitcoin and hopefully realize it's the apex financial asset (which I am becoming increasingly confident in the more I do my own research). Bitcoin's Price (Koyfin) Final Thoughts And What I Am Doing Strategy isn't the Fed, but its functional mimicry, as seen in rate adjustments, peg targeting, and reserve building, redefines Bitcoin's capital ecosystem. With all BTC purchases taking place being accretive (since they occur above NAV), BTC's prospects remaining as bright as ever (due to the debasement story, institutional adoption, and declining rates), and Strategy's own financing potentially declining dramatically if interest rates follow a downtrend, I remain bullish on MSTR. As mentioned in my previous article, I remain long by selling puts (still holding the MSTR Sep18'26 310 Put), which I believe offers a much better risk/reward setup along with direct Bitcoin exposure.",

        "body": "Bitcoin traded near $124,900 this week after comments from Telegram founder Pavel Durov drew attention back to its long-term potential. Speaking on the Lex Fridman Podcast, Durov said he believes Bitcoin could eventually reach $1 million per coin, citing its fixed supply and independence from government control as key advantages. His remarks come at a time when investors are reassessing Bitcoin’s role as an alternative to inflation-prone fiat currencies. Scarcity and Early Conviction Drive Bullish Outlook Durov said he became an early Bitcoin investor in 2013, buying several thousand coins at around $700 each. Even after steep market declines — including a drop below $200 — he chose to hold, describing Bitcoin as “digital gold.” He said its appeal lies in its independence: no central authority can seize or censor it, and its supply is permanently limited to 21 million coins. This scarcity remains central to Bitcoin’s value proposition. Increasingly, institutional investors share this view, treating BTC as a hedge against monetary expansion and weakening fiat currencies. Durov’s experience illustrates that perspective. He credits his Bitcoin holdings, rather than Telegram’s profits, for giving him the freedom to operate globally and independently. This position reinforces why many see Bitcoin as more than a speculative asset. Macro Trends Support the $1 Million Thesis Durov linked his $1 million Bitcoin projection to broader economic forces, particularly the long-term effects of expansive monetary policy. He argued that as governments continue to increase money supply to manage debt and stimulate growth, assets with fixed supply — like Bitcoin — stand to benefit. “I think this is how money should work,” he said. “Nobody can confiscate your Bitcoin, and nobody can censor you for political reasons.” Here's my 4+ hour conversation with Pavel Durov ( @durov ), founder and CEO of Telegram. This was one of the most fascinating and powerful conversations I've ever had in my life. We discuss everything from his philosophy on freedom to government bureaucracies, intelligence… pic.twitter.com/DDBTnE7A2t — Lex Fridman (@lexfridman) September 30, 2025 His view aligns with a growing sentiment among investors who see Bitcoin as a safeguard against currency erosion. With inflation pressures persisting and global debt levels rising, Bitcoin’s decentralized and finite structure provides a contrast to traditional systems that rely on central banks. Market reaction to Durov’s comments has been steady. Bitcoin’s ability to hold above $124,000 reflects continued institutional demand, despite short-term volatility persisting. For many, his remarks reinforce a longer-term narrative: that Bitcoin’s value is increasingly tied to its role as a counterweight to monetary excess rather than a short-lived speculative cycle. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Bearish Butterfly Nears Reversal Zone On the technical front , Bitcoin remains firmly in an uptrend, with price action continuing to follow the rising trendline that has defined October’s advance. The structure of higher highs and higher lows points to steady accumulation, while the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages — at $114,186 and $107,586 — provide clear dynamic support beneath the market. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The chart shows a Bearish Butterfly harmonic pattern approaching its Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) between $128,000 and $130,000. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) near 73 signals mildly overbought conditions, hinting at a short-term pause or pullback before any renewed push higher. As long as Bitcoin holds above $124,600, a move toward the $130,000 area remains likely. A clean breakout beyond that range would invalidate the bearish setup and potentially open a path toward $160,000 in the medium term. #Bitcoin consolidates near $125K as the Bearish Butterfly pattern nears its reversal zone at $128K–$130K. RSI hovers near 73, signaling short-term caution but sustained strength. A breakout above $130K could invalidate the pattern and open the path toward $160K. pic.twitter.com/ID1288MTiZ — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 7, 2025 At this stage, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above key support levels suggests consolidation rather than exhaustion. Combined with growing institutional inflows and renewed market optimism following Durov’s remarks, the broader outlook for Q4 2025 remains skewed to the upside.

Source: TradingVew The 19% weekly gain boosted BNB’s market cap to over $154 billion, surpassing both Tether and XRP behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. BNB Chain topped all blockchains in 24-hour fees, followed closely by Hyperledger and Solana. The rally coincided with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high above $126,000, as the ongoing US government shutdown drove investors to cryptocurrencies as safe-haven assets. Founder Changpeng Zhao emphasized ecosystem growth, with 30% of BNB’s supply now staked amid institutional inflows and the expansion of DeFi. The surge comes as October historically delivers a strong fourth-quarter performance for cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin averaging 79.6% gains in past Q4 periods.

CZ cited security concerns as the primary reason, stating he likes to “ stay logged out on Binance.com when not making a transaction ” and can go months without logging in. He noted he uses X to reach the “non-Binance community” as the center of broader crypto discourse. There are a few reasons I use X more than Binance Square. I like to stay logged out on https://t.co/9rMMAmczvH when not making a transaction, as a security policy. I go on for months without logging in. I like to reach non Binance community. But maybe I will switch back there https://t.co/A2Jsltrsqb — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 4, 2025 The comments received mixed reactions, with critics questioning why the founder would not be active in his own ecosystem. The contrast with Elon Musk’s frequent posting on X since acquiring Twitter in 2022 stands out sharply. CZ concluded by saying he will “ maybe ” switch back to Binance Square in the future. Broader Market Rally Driven by Political Uncertainty and Institutional Demand Bitcoin’s surge past $126,000 was accompanied by over $1 billion in spot ETF inflows , including nearly $970 million from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, with trading volume up more than 20% from the prior day. Analysts attribute the rally to the April halving, pro-crypto policies under the Trump administration, and Bitcoin’s appeal amid the political uncertainty caused by the government shutdown. Just yesterday, Strategy Inc. reported a $3.9 billion unrealized gain on its 640,031 BTC holdings in the third quarter, with total fair value reaching $47.35 billion. Earlier today, VanEck’s Matthew Sigel stated that surveys indicate younger consumers are increasingly favoring Bitcoin for wealth preservation over gold. He noted that around half of gold’s market value comes from its store of value role, and if Bitcoin captured half of that market, it would imply $644,000 per coin at today’s record gold price. We’ve been saying Bitcoin should reach half of gold’s market cap after the next halving. Roughly half of gold’s value reflects its use as a store of value rather than industrial or jewelry demand, and surveys show younger consumers in emerging markets increasingly prefer Bitcoin… — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) October 7, 2025 VanEck projects that Bitcoin could settle 10% of global trade by 2050, supporting a long-term price of $2.9 million per coin, equivalent to a $61 trillion market capitalization. Technical Analysis Projects $1,500 Target Following Breakout Pattern Hourly chart analysis reveals BNB trading at $1,266.83 following a breakout from consolidation near $1,193, with upside targets of approximately $1,347 representing a 6.3% gain. Source: X/@Tryrexcrypto Conversely, downside risk lies below $1,183, which would result in a potential 6.6% decline. The consolidation box around $1,193 represents the base from which the recent advance developed, with a relatively balanced risk-reward ratio suggesting a current equilibrium between buyers and sellers. To take it even further, daily chart analysis identifies three distinct phases of breakout. The first, from a $650 to $700 base, yields 27% gains, the second, from a $850 consolidation, yields 29% gains, and projections suggest the current third breakout could produce 51% gains, reaching $1,500. $BNB is repeating its perfect rhythm. First breakout gave 27% Second breakout gave 29% Now the third one is in play with a clear target near $1500, around 51% higher. The trend speaks for itself. Don’t overthink it. pic.twitter.com/66QTb8y6LI — Crypto King (@CryptoKing4Ever) October 7, 2025 However, the pattern of escalating percentage gains assumes unlimited buying power and ignores profit-taking dynamics that typically emerge after substantial advances. BNB has already delivered over 100% gains from recent bases around $600. The $1,500 target represents approximately 18.5% upside from current levels around $1,266, requiring BNB’s market capitalization to reach above $208 billion and entirely surpass XRP and USDT to solidify its position as the third-largest digital asset. The rally didn’t start overnight; BNB has recorded a price increase of over 99% in the past three months. Some analysts believe FOMO could push BNB toward $1,500 as the next psychological target, although ecosystem developments and treasury buying may already be reflected in current valuations. As it stands now, BNB could continue toward $1,400-$1,500 if momentum extends, although consolidation between $1,200-$1,350 appears more likely as markets digest recent 100%+ gains from $600 bases. A potential correction toward $1,100-$1,150 remains possible if profit-taking accelerates following the all-time high breakout, as the hourly chart’s balanced risk parameters contradict aggressive longer-term projections.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/croatia-football-federation-reward-crypto/",
        "body": "The Croatian Football Federation (HNS) has launched a new loyalty program that rewards fans with cryptocurrency through its official store app, making Croatia the first national football team to embed blockchain rewards directly into its fan engagement system. HNS released a public statement on Tuesday in conjunction with blockchain company Kadena, which joined forces in February this year. The multi-year collaboration extends through major global football tournaments, including the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 UEFA Euro Cup. The new feature went live on Tuesday, just two days before Croatia’s World Cup qualifier against the Czech Republic on October 9 and ahead of its next match versus Gibraltar on October 12. According to the federation, the timing of the product’s debut is meant to increase fan enthusiasm as Croatia pushes toward qualification for the 2026 World Cup. HNS Official Store app rewards go live Under the new system, fans who make purchases through the HNS Official Store app, such as jerseys, scarves, or other merchandise, will automatically receive 1% of their spending back in VATRENI tokens. The tokens, issued on Kadena’s blockchain network, are redeemable for team merchandise and VIP experiences. Future redemption options, such as match tickets, are expected to be added later, according to the federation. Each participating fan will also have a digital wallet connected to their app account, where they can earn, receive, and store rewards without handling the technical aspects crypto requires at times. The VATRENI token was first introduced as an ERC-20 asset on the Polygon network but has since migrated to Kadena’s blockchain via the Kinesis Bridge. Kadena’s technology, known for its scalable Proof-of-Work architecture called Chainweb, boasts of providing high transaction throughput with minimal fees. The blockchain platform supports both its proprietary smart contract language, Pact, and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility that is currently in testnet, to make development accessible for mainstream applications. “The goal with the VATRENI token is to push the boundaries of traditional fan engagement and introduce a future-focused experience,” denoted Joel Woodman, Kadena’s Head of Partnerships. “We’re working with our partners to integrate new technology into the Croatian Football Federation ecosystem, including AI tools, virtual experiences, and personalized activations.” Croatia national team seeks fan engagement through digital tokens During the Kadena partnership announcement in February, HNS President Marijan Kustić said the federation is responding to how fan behavior is leaning towards cryptocurrencies. “The mission of HNS is to ensure the development of Croatian football for the future, aligned with trends not only in sports but also in society as a whole. Cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence have become part of everyday life, so we are keeping pace with that development through our VATRENI project.” The HNS Official Store app is available for download on both the Apple App Store and Google Play. Once logged in, fans can browse official merchandise and automatically receive crypto rewards for purchases without additional setup. Kadena’s system processes the blockchain transactions, so users do not need prior crypto experience to participate. The partnership also includes promotional elements such as ticket giveaways and reward pools for app users. The federation expects the initiative to increase app downloads in the coming months, with projections of hundreds of thousands of wallets being created before the next World Cup is held next year in Canada, Mexico and the United States. According to stats from ESPN, Croatia is leading Group L of the UEFA World Cup Qualifications, having won all four of their games against Montenegro, Faroe Islands, Czechia and Gibraltar. Croatia is among a small but growing number of football organizations experimenting with blockchain-based fan programs. Several European clubs have released fan tokens in recent years, although HNS is the first national team to integrate crypto rewards directly into its official commerce platform. Paris Saint-Germain’s fan token ($PSG) caught the interest of football fans during the 2024–25 season, particularly after the club won a treble including the UEFA Champions League trophy.

        "body": "Stimulus checks funded by tariff revenue could act as a short-term liquidity catalyst for crypto markets by putting discretionary cash into retail hands during a US government shutdown, increasing buying power and potentially lifting demand for Bitcoin and other digital assets. Stimulus checks may boost retail liquidity into crypto markets Tariff revenues are being cited as a possible funding source for $1,000–$2,000 per-person dividends. US Treasury data shows ~$214 billion in tariff revenue year-to-date; traders see a 68% chance of an extended shutdown (Polymarket). Stimulus checks could lift crypto demand — stimulus checks front-loaded; read how tariff-funded payouts may act as a liquidity catalyst and what traders should watch. Amid growing demand for safe-haven assets due to a US government shutdown, stimulus checks may bring an “additional liquidity catalyst,” market analysts told observers. United States President Donald Trump has floated the idea of using import tariff revenue for another stimulus package, signaling another tailwind for crypto markets, alongside the ongoing government shutdown. President Trump said that he is considering giving Americans up to $2,000 in stimulus checks funded by revenue generated from import tariffs, according to an interview on the One America News Network published on Thursday. While the revenue from tariffs is just “starting to kick in,” they will ultimately generate “over a trillion dollars a year,” said Trump during the interview, adding that another part of the revenue will be used to pay the nation’s $37 trillion federal debt. The proposed “dividend” plan would distribute between $1,000 and $2,000 per individual, pending congressional approval. President Trump’s interview with One American News Network. Source: YouTube The US government has collected approximately $214 billion in tariff revenue so far in 2025, according to data from the Department of the Treasury reviewed by observers at Fox Business. Analysts say that if a tariff-funded dividend is enacted, it could inject measurable cash into consumer accounts within weeks. US tariff revenue. Source: Department of the Treasury, Fox Business What are stimulus checks and how could they affect crypto markets? Stimulus checks are direct payments to individuals intended to boost consumer spending; when distributed, they can increase retail liquidity that may flow into financial and digital-asset markets. Historically, COVID-era stimulus contributed to heightened retail participation in crypto, and a new tariff-funded payout could reproduce similar short-term demand effects. How would a tariff-funded $1,000–$2,000 stimulus dividend act as a liquidity catalyst? Tariff-funded stimulus would put discretionary funds directly into bank accounts, increasing purchasing power for a segment of consumers. Bitfinex exchange analysts noted a parallel with the 2020 stimulus injections that helped fuel Bitcoin’s rally in 2020–2021. In March 2020, a $2 trillion package distributed up to $1,200 per eligible person and coincided with a period of quantitative easing. Bitcoin rose from roughly $6,000 in March 2020 to $69,000 by November 2021, though that period also included a large Fed bond-buying program. BTC/USD, one-week chart, 2020–2021. Source: TradingView Quantitative easing (QE) amplified liquidity conditions by lowering interest rates and encouraging risk-taking. Even without QE, one-off stimulus deposits can temporarily lift consumer risk appetite and reallocate capital into higher-risk assets including crypto. Meanwhile, the US government shutdown entered its seventh day on Tuesday, with lawmakers failing to pass a key funding bill. The Senate is set to reconvene later today, but no resolution is guaranteed. Odds of the government shutdown ending by Oct. 15. Source: Polymarket Traders see a 68% chance that the shutdown will end on Oct. 15 or later on the prediction market platform Polymarket. Market participants say timing and scale of any stimulus matter: direct deposits increase liquidity, but longer-term price direction depends on macro policy, Fed actions, and investor risk appetite. Frequently Asked Questions Could tariff-funded stimulus checks directly cause a Bitcoin price rally? Direct causation is unlikely to be singular; however, tariff-funded stimulus checks could inject retail liquidity that contributes to short-term upward pressure if a meaningful portion flows into crypto markets within a concentrated timeframe. How quickly would stimulus checks enter markets if approved? If congressional approval is secured, deposits can appear in consumer accounts within weeks to months depending on distribution mechanics; immediate spending patterns determine how rapidly liquidity reaches asset markets. What risks should investors consider? Investors should consider policy uncertainty, potential market sell-the-news reactions, and macro factors like interest-rate policy. Past stimulus-driven rallies also coincided with expansive central-bank measures, which may not repeat. Key Takeaways Stimulus checks as liquidity: Tariff-funded payments could increase retail cash available for investment, including crypto. Historical precedent: COVID-era stimulus coincided with major crypto gains, but QE and other policy moves contributed significantly. Watch variables: Timing, scale of payments, Fed policy, and shutdown duration will determine market impact. Conclusion Stimulus checks funded by tariff revenue could act as an additional liquidity catalyst for crypto markets during a government shutdown, but the magnitude of any market move will depend on the payments’ timing, size, and concurrent monetary policy. Monitor official Treasury data, congressional actions, and central bank signals for clearer implications. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/article/stimulus-checks-liquidity-catalyst-2025\" }, \"headline\": \"Tariff-Funded Stimulus Checks Could Act as Crypto Liquidity Catalyst During US Shutdown\", \"image\": [ \"https://en.coinotag.com/uploads/2025-10/0199be74-4a70-714d-877d-d56905599fc4\" ], \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-10T12:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-10T12:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo-coinotag.png\" } }, \"description\": \"Stimulus checks could lift crypto demand — tariff-funded payouts may act as a liquidity catalyst during a US government shutdown, analysts say.\"} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Could tariff-funded stimulus checks directly cause a Bitcoin price rally?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Tariff-funded checks could increase retail liquidity that helps push prices higher short-term, but a direct one-to-one causation is unlikely; broader monetary policy and market conditions also drive major rallies.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How quickly would stimulus checks enter markets if approved?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"If approved, stimulus deposits can appear in accounts within weeks to months depending on distribution logistics; the speed of consumer spending determines how fast liquidity reaches asset markets.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"What are the main risks for investors?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Policy uncertainty, central bank actions, and potential sell-the-news reactions are key risks; past stimulus-driven rallies were also influenced by large-scale monetary easing.\" } } ]} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How stimulus checks could flow into crypto markets\", \"description\": \"Steps describing how tariff-funded stimulus checks might increase liquidity and affect crypto prices.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"position\": 1, \"name\": \"Congress approves tariff-funded dividend\", \"text\": \"Legislation or executive action must authorize distribution of tariff revenue to households.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"position\": 2, \"name\": \"Payments are distributed to consumers\", \"text\": \"Deposits land in bank accounts, increasing disposable income for recipients.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"position\": 3, \"name\": \"A portion of funds is allocated to investments\", \"text\": \"Some recipients choose to allocate part of the payments to savings, stocks, or digital assets.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"position\": 4, \"name\": \"Increased demand affects market prices\", \"text\": \"Concentrated buying can create upward price pressure, especially in illiquid or retail-driven markets.\" } ]}",

        "body": "Dubai, UAE, October 7th, 2025, Chainwire Pepeto , an Ethereum-based meme coin project, has raised over $6.93 million during its ongoing presale. The token is currently offered at a fixed presale price of $0.000000157, with a total supply of 420 trillion—mirroring PEPE’s tokenomics. As part of its early-stage development, Pepeto has launched a demo version of its decentralized exchange, PepetoSwap, and is building a cross-chain bridge to support liquidity and interoperability. The project also offers staking at a 222% APY, aimed at rewarding participants during the presale phase. BNB Market Update: $1,244 Price, $173B Market Cap, and Q4 Outlook BNB is trading at $1,244.17 with a market capitalization of $173.17 billion, continuing an upward trend after breaking out of a flag pattern and retesting the $1,000 level as support. Analysts highlight consolidation near the $1,200 mark, with identified technical levels between $1,300 and $1,350. Market attention remains focused on the ongoing competition between Binance and Coinbase as Q4 unfolds. Ethereum ATH Metrics and BNB Scarcity Consideration Ethereum (ETH), created by Vitalik Buterin, is currently priced at $4,714.63 and nearing its previous all-time high of $4,900. On a return basis, ETH offers limited room for short-term gains at current levels. In contrast, a token such as BNB, if priced against ETH’s historical highs, would mathematically reflect a higher return multiple due to its current market price. BNB’s circulating supply of approximately 139.18 million is often cited in discussions around long-term scarcity. Meme Coin Market Overview: PEPE, SHIB, and DOGE PEPE is trading at $0.00001020, with a prior ATH of $0.00002479. SHIB stands at $0.00001282, close to its peak of $0.00001283. DOGE is priced at $0.2667, with a previous high near $0.57. These tokens each exhibit distinct market trajectories and historical volatility profiles. Community Commentary and Project Narrative Online discussions around Pepeto have drawn comparisons to PEPE, with some community members referencing a reported shift in direction by a former contributor associated with the original “TO” (Technology and Optimization) concept. While such claims remain unverified, the Pepeto project has received attention for launching products during the presale and pursuing infrastructure development.

He noted he uses X to reach the “non-Binance community” as the center of broader crypto discourse. There are a few reasons I use X more than Binance Square. I like to stay logged out on https://t.co/9rMMAmczvH when not making a transaction, as a security policy. I go on for months without logging in. I like to reach non Binance community. But maybe I will switch back there https://t.co/A2Jsltrsqb — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 4, 2025 The comments received mixed reactions, with critics questioning why the founder would not be active in his own ecosystem. The contrast with Elon Musk’s frequent posting on X since acquiring Twitter in 2022 stands out sharply. CZ concluded by saying he will “ maybe ” switch back to Binance Square in the future. Broader Market Rally Driven by Political Uncertainty and Institutional Demand Bitcoin’s surge past $126,000 was accompanied by over $1 billion in spot ETF inflows , including nearly $970 million from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, with trading volume up more than 20% from the prior day. Analysts attribute the rally to the April halving, pro-crypto policies under the Trump administration, and Bitcoin’s appeal amid the political uncertainty caused by the government shutdown. Just yesterday, Strategy Inc. reported a $3.9 billion unrealized gain on its 640,031 BTC holdings in the third quarter, with total fair value reaching $47.35 billion. Earlier today, VanEck’s Matthew Sigel stated that surveys indicate younger consumers are increasingly favoring Bitcoin for wealth preservation over gold. He noted that around half of gold’s market value comes from its store of value role, and if Bitcoin captured half of that market, it would imply $644,000 per coin at today’s record gold price. We’ve been saying Bitcoin should reach half of gold’s market cap after the next halving. Roughly half of gold’s value reflects its use as a store of value rather than industrial or jewelry demand, and surveys show younger consumers in emerging markets increasingly prefer Bitcoin… — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) October 7, 2025 VanEck projects that Bitcoin could settle 10% of global trade by 2050, supporting a long-term price of $2.9 million per coin, equivalent to a $61 trillion market capitalization. Technical Analysis Projects $1,500 Target Following Breakout Pattern Hourly chart analysis reveals BNB trading at $1,266.83 following a breakout from consolidation near $1,193, with upside targets of approximately $1,347 representing a 6.3% gain. Source: X/@Tryrexcrypto Conversely, downside risk lies below $1,183, which would result in a potential 6.6% decline. The consolidation box around $1,193 represents the base from which the recent advance developed, with a relatively balanced risk-reward ratio suggesting a current equilibrium between buyers and sellers. To take it even further, daily chart analysis identifies three distinct phases of breakout. The first, from a $650 to $700 base, yields 27% gains, the second, from a $850 consolidation, yields 29% gains, and projections suggest the current third breakout could produce 51% gains, reaching $1,500. $BNB is repeating its perfect rhythm. First breakout gave 27% Second breakout gave 29% Now the third one is in play with a clear target near $1500, around 51% higher. The trend speaks for itself. Don’t overthink it. pic.twitter.com/66QTb8y6LI — Crypto King (@CryptoKing4Ever) October 7, 2025 However, the pattern of escalating percentage gains assumes unlimited buying power and ignores profit-taking dynamics that typically emerge after substantial advances. BNB has already delivered over 100% gains from recent bases around $600. The $1,500 target represents approximately 18.5% upside from current levels around $1,266, requiring BNB’s market capitalization to reach above $208 billion and entirely surpass XRP and USDT to solidify its position as the third-largest digital asset. The rally didn’t start overnight; BNB has recorded a price increase of over 99% in the past three months. Some analysts believe FOMO could push BNB toward $1,500 as the next psychological target, although ecosystem developments and treasury buying may already be reflected in current valuations. As it stands now, BNB could continue toward $1,400-$1,500 if momentum extends, although consolidation between $1,200-$1,350 appears more likely as markets digest recent 100%+ gains from $600 bases. A potential correction toward $1,100-$1,150 remains possible if profit-taking accelerates following the all-time high breakout, as the hourly chart’s balanced risk parameters contradict aggressive longer-term projections.

        "body": "There have been changes in the top 10 rankings on Coinmarketcap. Binance Coin (BNB), which has been performing incredibly for days, has left well-established altcoins behind. Accordingly, BNB left behind Tether (USDT) and XRP with a remarkable performance. As the BNB rally continues, BNB has moved into third place in terms of market capitalization, leaving behind XRP and USDT. BNB, which broke a new record of $1,283 on the Binance USDT spot market, has risen to approximately $178.9 billion in market value, according to CoinMarketCap data. According to the latest changes, BNB rose to the 3rd place among the largest cryptocurrencies, while XRP fell to the 4th place. Meanwhile, Tether (USDT) fell to 5th place, just behind XRP. It is estimated that this rise in BNB, which broke a new record by exceeding $1,100 in the past weeks, is due to increased buying pressure in futures transactions and rumors that more spot BNB ETF applications are coming. According to Coinglass data, BNB futures open interest continues to rise, while short positions broke a record in the last hour. BNB led the way with the most short liquidations, with $1.64 million liquidated in the last hour. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Top 10 Cryptocurrency Ranking Changes!

        "body": "Institutional demand for Ethereum is hitting new highs, with treasury firms and exchange-traded funds now holding over 12.48 million ETH, roughly 10.31% of the network’s total supply. Key Takeaways: Institutions and ETFs now hold over 12.48 million ETH, marking a major shift toward Ethereum as a treasury asset. Spot Ether ETFs saw $621 million in inflows in October, more than doubling the previous month. SharpLink has amassed 839,000 ETH and plans to stake on Ethereum’s Linea network for added yield. According to data from StrategicETHReserve , corporate treasuries hold about 5.66 million ETH (4.68% of supply), while spot Ethereum ETFs have amassed another 6.81 million ETH (5.63%). The figures underscore a growing shift among institutions toward Ethereum as a productive asset, mirroring the corporate Bitcoin accumulation trend seen in recent years. Spot Ether ETF Inflows Hit $621M in October, Doubling September’s Total October saw US-listed spot Ether ETFs record net inflows of $621.4 million, more than doubling September’s $285.7 million, per SoSoValue. In August, inflows peaked at $3.9 billion, suggesting a sustained appetite for Ethereum exposure. One standout example is SharpLink Gaming, which revealed this week it now holds 839,000 ETH with no debt on its balance sheet. The company, listed on Nasdaq under the ticker SBET, launched its ETH treasury strategy in June and has seen its unrealized profits soar past $900 million since then. SharpLink said it has doubled its ETH concentration over the past four months. “This is the power of a productive and yield-bearing asset like ETH,” the company wrote in a post on X. SharpLink’s unrealized profit now surpasses $900M since launching the ETH treasury strategy on June 2, 2025. During that time, ETH concentration doubled, making every share more valuable. With 839k ETH on our balance sheet and no debt, SharpLink’s in a strong position to keep… pic.twitter.com/4HlQWRZjvw — SharpLink (SBET) (@SharpLinkGaming) October 6, 2025 Beyond holding ETH, SharpLink is also preparing to tokenize its common stock (SBET) on Ethereum and has plans to stake part of its holdings on Linea, Ethereum’s Layer 2 network developed by Consensys. Joseph Lubin, chairman of SharpLink and founder of Consensys, said Linea could offer attractive risk-adjusted yields for institutions. “SharpLink is going to continue to accumulate [ether],” Lubin said, adding that staking on Linea could make it “the best place to deploy your ether at Layer 2.” XWIN Finance: $10K Ethereum Is a Liquidity-Driven Possibility Crypto hedge fund XWIN Finance argues that Ethereum could realistically reach $10,000 this cycle , driven by macro liquidity trends. As global M2 money supply hits record highs and ETH exchange reserves decline sharply, analysts say Ethereum is entering a “revaluation phase” similar to Bitcoin’s rally pattern during past liquidity surges. While Bitcoin has already surged over 130% since 2022 in response to M2 expansion, Ethereum has lagged with only a 15% gain. However, ETH exchange reserves have dropped by over 25% since 2022, and negative netflows signal that coins are being locked in staking or cold wallets, reducing sell pressure. Institutional demand is also picking up, with the Coinbase Premium Index turning positive. Historically, ETH outperforms once Bitcoin dominance falls below 60%, often triggering capital rotation into altcoins. With early indicators resembling the 2020–2021 cycle, XWIN believes that 2025 could be Ethereum’s breakout year, with $10K driven by structural liquidity. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, also believes that $10,000 Ethereum by the end of 2025 seems well within reach. In a July blog post , Hayes laid out his thesis, tying the potential price surge to US President Donald Trump’s economic policies and what he describes as a shift to a wartime economy.

        "body": "As traders debate the next big move for XRP, attention is also turning toward a promising new DeFi project, Remittix (RTX) . With XRP consolidating near its all-time high, and Bitcoin investors shifting funds into high-utility altcoins, the real buzz surrounds Remittix, a new PayFi presale that’s already becoming the best new altcoin. XRP Price Prediction: Price Increase Ahead? XRP is priced around $3.00. Popular crypto trader CryptoWZRD believes this consolidation phase is setting up for an explosive breakout. As long as the token stays above $1.90 and $2.50, the analyst predicts that XRP could reach $3.65, and from there, $4.50. Source: @cryptoWZRD_ on X Adding to the bullish sentiment, XForceGlobal has projected a long-term XRP price prediction of $50 to $60 . Similarly, crypto analyst BarriC foresees a massive rally, estimating that XRP could skyrocket to $10–$20 by early 2026. Also, Bitcoin is priced at around $124,998, but many of its investors are beginning to move to more utility-focused altcoin presales, like Remittix. This move signals that Remittix’s record-breaking presale is doing a great job at attracting top investors. Remittix: PayFi Revolution Attracting Investors Remittix, a low gas fee crypto project , is aiming to change the multi-trillion-dollar remittance industry. Remittix has raised $27.1 million and sold 676 million tokens at $0.1130 each, making it one of the top crypto under $1 and the next big altcoin of 2025. The Remittix DeFi project merges payment and finance and focuses on real-world applications rather than hype. Designed to make global money transfers faster and cheaper, Remittix is rapidly becoming the next 100x crypto on every investor’s radar. The project’s growth is backed by real progress: The Remittix Wallet Beta has been live for almost three weeks, with early testers praising its speed and interface. The team has already rolled out a second update incorporating user feedback, showing dedication to community-driven development. CertiK, one of the industry’s most respected blockchain security firms, has audited and approved Remittix, ensuring safety and trust for investors. The first CEX listings on Bitmart and LBank are confirmed, with another major exchange reveal coming soon. The Web App is nearing completion, with Beta testing expected by mid-Q4. With its 15% referral bonus in USDT, investors can earn instantly by inviting others to join. Rewards are claimable every 24 hours, allowing participants to earn passive income while supporting project growth. Should You Join Remittix? The XRP price prediction outlook shows incredible promise, with analysts calling for massive gains in the coming months.

        "body": "Bitcoin traded near $124,900 this week after comments from Telegram founder Pavel Durov drew attention back to its long-term potential. Speaking on the Lex Fridman Podcast, Durov said he believes Bitcoin could eventually reach $1 million per coin, citing its fixed supply and independence from government control as key advantages. His remarks come at a time when investors are reassessing Bitcoin’s role as an alternative to inflation-prone fiat currencies. Scarcity and Early Conviction Drive Bullish Outlook Durov said he became an early Bitcoin investor in 2013, buying several thousand coins at around $700 each. Even after steep market declines — including a drop below $200 — he chose to hold, describing Bitcoin as “digital gold.” He said its appeal lies in its independence: no central authority can seize or censor it, and its supply is permanently limited to 21 million coins. This scarcity remains central to Bitcoin’s value proposition. Increasingly, institutional investors share this view, treating BTC as a hedge against monetary expansion and weakening fiat currencies. Durov’s experience illustrates that perspective. He credits his Bitcoin holdings, rather than Telegram’s profits, for giving him the freedom to operate globally and independently. This position reinforces why many see Bitcoin as more than a speculative asset. Macro Trends Support the $1 Million Thesis Durov linked his $1 million Bitcoin projection to broader economic forces, particularly the long-term effects of expansive monetary policy. He argued that as governments continue to increase money supply to manage debt and stimulate growth, assets with fixed supply — like Bitcoin — stand to benefit. “I think this is how money should work,” he said. “Nobody can confiscate your Bitcoin, and nobody can censor you for political reasons.” Here's my 4+ hour conversation with Pavel Durov ( @durov ), founder and CEO of Telegram. This was one of the most fascinating and powerful conversations I've ever had in my life. We discuss everything from his philosophy on freedom to government bureaucracies, intelligence… pic.twitter.com/DDBTnE7A2t — Lex Fridman (@lexfridman) September 30, 2025 His view aligns with a growing sentiment among investors who see Bitcoin as a safeguard against currency erosion. With inflation pressures persisting and global debt levels rising, Bitcoin’s decentralized and finite structure provides a contrast to traditional systems that rely on central banks. Market reaction to Durov’s comments has been steady. Bitcoin’s ability to hold above $124,000 reflects continued institutional demand, despite short-term volatility persisting. For many, his remarks reinforce a longer-term narrative: that Bitcoin’s value is increasingly tied to its role as a counterweight to monetary excess rather than a short-lived speculative cycle. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Bearish Butterfly Nears Reversal Zone On the technical front , Bitcoin remains firmly in an uptrend, with price action continuing to follow the rising trendline that has defined October’s advance. The structure of higher highs and higher lows points to steady accumulation, while the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages — at $114,186 and $107,586 — provide clear dynamic support beneath the market. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The chart shows a Bearish Butterfly harmonic pattern approaching its Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) between $128,000 and $130,000. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) near 73 signals mildly overbought conditions, hinting at a short-term pause or pullback before any renewed push higher. As long as Bitcoin holds above $124,600, a move toward the $130,000 area remains likely. A clean breakout beyond that range would invalidate the bearish setup and potentially open a path toward $160,000 in the medium term. #Bitcoin consolidates near $125K as the Bearish Butterfly pattern nears its reversal zone at $128K–$130K. RSI hovers near 73, signaling short-term caution but sustained strength. A breakout above $130K could invalidate the pattern and open the path toward $160K. pic.twitter.com/ID1288MTiZ — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 7, 2025 At this stage, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above key support levels suggests consolidation rather than exhaustion. Combined with growing institutional inflows and renewed market optimism following Durov’s remarks, the broader outlook for Q4 2025 remains skewed to the upside.

        "body": "Meanwhile, the first regulated life insurance company that operates entirely in bitcoin (BTC), said on Tuesday it has raised $82 million to scale its savings and retirement products that aim to protect against inflation and currency devaluation. The funding round was co-led by Bain Capital Crypto and Haun Ventures, with participation from Pantera Capital, Apollo, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures and Stillmark, the firm shared in a press release with CoinDesk. The raise follows a $40 million round in April led by Fulgur Ventures and Framework, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was an early investor. Founded in Bermuda, Meanwhile offers life insurance and annuity products denominated in BTC, allowing policyholders to save and transfer wealth in an asset with a fixed supply. The service aims to guard customers against inflation and currency devaluation over time, but policyholders also take on bitcoin’s price volatility. Its products are regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority and designed to mirror traditional long-term financial tools, but in BTC. The company earns returns on held bitcoin through long-term lending to private credit markets, helping it meet claims obligations and maintain solvency standards similar to legacy insurers. \"Life insurers have always provided the steady, long-term capital that keeps financial markets moving,\" Zac Townsend, CEO of Meanwhile, said in a statement. \"We’re bringing that same role to Bitcoin — helping families save and protect wealth in BTC, while giving institutions new ways to earn returns and launch bitcoin-indexed products that are compliant and easy to scale.\" Meanwhile’s approach has found traction among both individuals and institutions, underscoring a surge in interest from customers seeking alternatives to dollar-based insurance and treasury products, the firm said. The company said its bitcoin assets under management has grown over 200% this year, outpacing bitcoin's 34% year-to date run to record highs. \"At Haun Ventures, our thesis is that the Bitcoin economy needs more than trading platforms and DATs — it needs the core building blocks of capital markets,\" said Chris Ahn, partner at Haun Ventures, in a statement. \"Just as the U.S. economy was built on insurance, pensions, and mortgages, the Bitcoin economy will require its own long-duration financial products.\" The firm said the new capital will be used to partner with traditional insurers, grow internationally and develop new bitcoin-linked retirement tools that meet regulatory standards.",

        "body": "Chainlink’s token, LINK, is riding a new wave of optimism after breaking through the $22.75 resistance mark, fueled by fresh partnerships and renewed investor confidence. The price surge follows BNB Chain’s integration of Chainlink’s data oracles to bring verified US economic data on-chain, a move that strengthens the project’s role at the heart of blockchain-based financial infrastructure. The integration has helped ignite a sharp rebound in LINK’s price, lifting it 3.2% in the past 24 hours to a daily high of $23.67 on CoinMarketCap , outpacing the broader crypto market’s 0.73% gain. Notably, this comes as Bitcoin (BTC) hit a fresh all-time high (ATH) of $126,198.07, setting an upbeat tone across digital assets. BNB partnership gives Chainlink new real-world reach The collaboration between BNB Chain and Chainlink marks a turning point for decentralised data infrastructure. Through Chainlink’s Data Standard, real-time statistics from the US Department of Commerce and the Bureau of Economic Analysis — such as GDP, the PCE Price Index, and Real Final Sales — are now accessible directly on-chain. This integration allows developers to build decentralised finance (DeFi) products that respond to verified economic data rather than third-party estimates. The move transforms how smart contracts interact with the real world. Developers can now design inflation-linked tokens, GDP-based derivatives, and risk models that mirror actual macroeconomic conditions. The integration also expands Chainlink’s influence beyond technical oracles into a bridge between global economies and DeFi. It also positions Chainlink as a critical layer for the growing tokenised real-world asset (RAW) market, projected to exceed $30 trillion in value. Technical breakout fuels investor confidence On the charts, LINK’s technical setup has turned decisively bullish. After weeks of consolidation under pressure, the token has broken out of a “cup and handle” formation and is now completing a bullish flag pattern. The breakout above $22.75 signals the start of a potential continuation rally, with short-term resistance targets sitting at $24.63 and $25.93. If momentum holds, the next major resistance lies at $27.32, a price region that could pave the way toward the long-term psychological target near $30, according to market analysts . Analysts note that LINK’s seven-day simple moving average recently crossed above its 30-day counterpart, a pattern often viewed as a bullish confirmation. Source: CoinMarketCap On-chain data also shows mixed signals, as a large holder reportedly sold 700,000 LINK at a loss earlier this week, suggesting mild profit-taking as prices climb. Beyond the current price rally, Chainlink’s role in bringing verified government and financial data to blockchain networks is viewed as a foundational step for the next phase of DeFi maturity. By securing partnerships with Binance’s BNB Chain, ICE, and Mastercard, Chainlink (LINK) is strengthening its position as the backbone of data reliability in Web3 ecosystems.

What are SharpLink Gaming’s Ethereum holdings and current unrealized gains? SharpLink Gaming’s Ethereum holdings consist of roughly 838,730 ETH, valued at about $3.93 billion after Ether’s recent rally. The gaming company reports unrealized gains exceeding $900 million, reflecting the price rise to near $4,700 and the firm’s strategic accumulation since June 2. How did SharpLink accumulate its ETH and what market impact does this have? SharpLink initiated a deliberate accumulation program in early summer, purchasing initial lots totaling ~176,300 ETH and adding through buying waves in July and August. Holdings stabilized near 839,000 ETH by September, and recent price appreciation raised the market value significantly. By holding a large supply of a yield-generating asset like Ether, SharpLink increases per-share concentration and long-term earning potential. Company commentary states: “With 839k ETH on our balance sheet and no debt, SharpLink is well-positioned to sustain value creation for shareholders.” Strategic ETH Reserve and corporate treasury data referenced by industry observers show a broader institutional trend toward ETH accumulation. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/sharplink-ethereum-treasury-update\" }, \"headline\": \"SharpLink Gaming’s Ethereum Holdings Gain Over $900M as ETH Rally Boosts Portfolio\", \"description\": \"SharpLink Gaming's Ethereum holdings surged after Ether rallied to near $4,700, producing unrealized gains above $900M on ~838,730 ETH, highlighting rising corporate treasury ETH exposure.\", \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-07T08:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-07T08:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png\" } }} Why does SharpLink’s ETH position matter to markets and investors? SharpLink’s stake represents about 0.69% of ETH’s total supply, making the company one of the largest single holders among corporates. Large corporate treasuries can reduce circulating supply available to spot markets and can amplify price sensitivity to institutional flows. Industry tallies indicate corporate treasuries hold over 5.6 million ETH (~$26.5B) and, when combined with ETFs, institutional reserves reach ~6.83 million ETH (~$32B). Together with exchange-traded holdings, corporate and ETF balances are estimated at ~12.4 million ETH, exceeding 10% of total supply—data points referenced from market analytics providers (no external links). Frequently Asked Questions How much profit has SharpLink realized from ETH? SharpLink reports unrealized profits surpassing $900 million; these are paper gains tied to the market value increase of approximately 838,730 ETH since the company began accumulating in June. Is SharpLink holding debt or using leverage for its ETH purchases? According to the company statement, SharpLink holds the ETH position with no debt. This suggests purchases were funded from corporate resources rather than leverage, lowering counterparty risk from margin or borrowing. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How many ETH does SharpLink Gaming hold?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"SharpLink holds approximately 838,730 ETH, valued near $3.93 billion after Ether's recent rally.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"What are the unrealized gains from SharpLink's ETH holdings?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Unrealized gains on SharpLink's ETH holdings exceed $900 million following a nearly 4.5% 24-hour rise in Ether's price.\" } } ]} How does SharpLink compare with other corporate ETH holders? SharpLink ranks among the larger corporate ETH wallets, but several firms and ETFs hold significantly more—industry data notes corporate treasuries collectively control millions of ETH, with some enterprises reported to hold multiple million-coin positions. For context, combined corporate and ETF reserves equate to more than 10% of ETH supply, increasing the strategic importance of corporate treasuries in liquidity dynamics. Key Takeaways Sizeable Position : SharpLink holds ~838,730 ETH (~$3.93B), one of the largest single corporate positions. Material Unrealized Gains : Paper gains exceed $900M after ETH rallied to near $4,700. Broader Trend : Institutional and ETF ETH reserves total ~12.4M ETH, indicating meaningful corporate exposure to Ether. Conclusion SharpLink Gaming’s ETH accumulation and resulting unrealized gains highlight a broader institutional trend toward Ethereum as a corporate treasury asset. Investors should note the increasing share of ETH held by companies and ETFs, which can affect market liquidity and price behavior.

        "body": "Binance Coin ( BNB ) surged past $1,300 on October 6, 2025, marking its second all-time high within hours after initially breaking $1,200 earlier in the day, as the token flipped XRP to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Source: TradingVew The 19% weekly gain boosted BNB’s market cap to over $154 billion, surpassing both Tether and XRP behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. BNB Chain topped all blockchains in 24-hour fees, followed closely by Hyperledger and Solana. The rally coincided with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high above $126,000, as the ongoing US government shutdown drove investors to cryptocurrencies as safe-haven assets. Founder Changpeng Zhao emphasized ecosystem growth, with 30% of BNB’s supply now staked amid institutional inflows and the expansion of DeFi. The surge comes as October historically delivers a strong fourth-quarter performance for cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin averaging 79.6% gains in past Q4 periods. JUST IN: $BNB reaches new ATH of $1,300 pic.twitter.com/wVvWHElltX — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) October 7, 2025 CZ Admits Preferring X Over Binance Square Despite BNB Rally Amid these wild runs towards new ATHs, Changpeng Zhao admitted he personally prefers using X over Binance’s own social platform, Binance Square, despite the latter reaching 275 million users since launching in 2023. CZ cited security concerns as the primary reason, stating he likes to “ stay logged out on Binance.com when not making a transaction ” and can go months without logging in. He noted he uses X to reach the “non-Binance community” as the center of broader crypto discourse. There are a few reasons I use X more than Binance Square. I like to stay logged out on https://t.co/9rMMAmczvH when not making a transaction, as a security policy. I go on for months without logging in. I like to reach non Binance community. But maybe I will switch back there https://t.co/A2Jsltrsqb — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 4, 2025 The comments received mixed reactions, with critics questioning why the founder would not be active in his own ecosystem. The contrast with Elon Musk’s frequent posting on X since acquiring Twitter in 2022 stands out sharply. CZ concluded by saying he will “ maybe ” switch back to Binance Square in the future. Broader Market Rally Driven by Political Uncertainty and Institutional Demand Bitcoin’s surge past $126,000 was accompanied by over $1 billion in spot ETF inflows , including nearly $970 million from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, with trading volume up more than 20% from the prior day. Analysts attribute the rally to the April halving, pro-crypto policies under the Trump administration, and Bitcoin’s appeal amid the political uncertainty caused by the government shutdown. Just yesterday, Strategy Inc. reported a $3.9 billion unrealized gain on its 640,031 BTC holdings in the third quarter, with total fair value reaching $47.35 billion. Earlier today, VanEck’s Matthew Sigel stated that surveys indicate younger consumers are increasingly favoring Bitcoin for wealth preservation over gold. He noted that around half of gold’s market value comes from its store of value role, and if Bitcoin captured half of that market, it would imply $644,000 per coin at today’s record gold price. We’ve been saying Bitcoin should reach half of gold’s market cap after the next halving. Roughly half of gold’s value reflects its use as a store of value rather than industrial or jewelry demand, and surveys show younger consumers in emerging markets increasingly prefer Bitcoin… — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) October 7, 2025 VanEck projects that Bitcoin could settle 10% of global trade by 2050, supporting a long-term price of $2.9 million per coin, equivalent to a $61 trillion market capitalization. Technical Analysis Projects $1,500 Target Following Breakout Pattern Hourly chart analysis reveals BNB trading at $1,266.83 following a breakout from consolidation near $1,193, with upside targets of approximately $1,347 representing a 6.3% gain. Source: X/@Tryrexcrypto Conversely, downside risk lies below $1,183, which would result in a potential 6.6% decline. The consolidation box around $1,193 represents the base from which the recent advance developed, with a relatively balanced risk-reward ratio suggesting a current equilibrium between buyers and sellers. To take it even further, daily chart analysis identifies three distinct phases of breakout. The first, from a $650 to $700 base, yields 27% gains, the second, from a $850 consolidation, yields 29% gains, and projections suggest the current third breakout could produce 51% gains, reaching $1,500. $BNB is repeating its perfect rhythm. First breakout gave 27% Second breakout gave 29% Now the third one is in play with a clear target near $1500, around 51% higher. The trend speaks for itself. Don’t overthink it. pic.twitter.com/66QTb8y6LI — Crypto King (@CryptoKing4Ever) October 7, 2025 However, the pattern of escalating percentage gains assumes unlimited buying power and ignores profit-taking dynamics that typically emerge after substantial advances. BNB has already delivered over 100% gains from recent bases around $600. The $1,500 target represents approximately 18.5% upside from current levels around $1,266, requiring BNB’s market capitalization to reach above $208 billion and entirely surpass XRP and USDT to solidify its position as the third-largest digital asset. The rally didn’t start overnight; BNB has recorded a price increase of over 99% in the past three months. Some analysts believe FOMO could push BNB toward $1,500 as the next psychological target, although ecosystem developments and treasury buying may already be reflected in current valuations. As it stands now, BNB could continue toward $1,400-$1,500 if momentum extends, although consolidation between $1,200-$1,350 appears more likely as markets digest recent 100%+ gains from $600 bases. A potential correction toward $1,100-$1,150 remains possible if profit-taking accelerates following the all-time high breakout, as the hourly chart’s balanced risk parameters contradict aggressive longer-term projections.

        "body": "In financial markets, the quiet before a breakout often conceals the most powerful moves. XRP now appears to be in that calm — a tightening range that’s preparing to erupt. After weeks of compressed trading and capped volatility, the cryptocurrency is positioned at a critical juncture. According to Elliott Wave analyst Hov, XRP could be on the verge of initiating one of its strongest upward impulses yet — a move that could swiftly carry it toward $6.90 if key technical conditions align. XRP’s Market Structure and Current Performance As of report time, XRP trades around $2.97, holding steady despite a broadly consolidating crypto market. The token’s recent price action has been characterized by higher lows and diminishing downside pressure, suggesting sustained accumulation beneath the surface. With Bitcoin hovering above $124,000, risk appetite across digital assets is recovering, providing a constructive backdrop for potential continuation in XRP. $XRP about to teleport to $6.9 Since our last XRP update it's been coiling up while capping downside to nothing more than wicks (threaded) We're right on the edge of confirming our wave 3 of 3 here Key will be getting a HTF close above 3.25ish Once that happens I believe… pic.twitter.com/KkfNrykKmV — Hov (@HovWaves) October 6, 2025 Traders observing the daily chart have noted that XRP’s structure has been coiling within a tight range between the high-$2 zone and the low-$3 area. Each minor dip has been met with renewed buying, reinforcing a sense of latent strength. This accumulation phase, according to Hov, is the necessary prelude to the next major impulsive leg. Inside Hov’s Elliott Wave Thesis In his latest X post, Hov describes XRP’s current setup as the prelude to a “wave 3 of 3” formation — the most explosive stage in Elliott Wave theory, known for producing steep and sustained rallies. He identifies the $3.25 region as the decisive barrier that must be broken and held on a high-timeframe (HTF) close for the next wave to be confirmed. Once that condition is met, the technical model projects an accelerated climb toward $6.90, aligning with Fibonacci extension targets often seen in major third-wave expansions. Hov’s analysis highlights that the asset has held firm through its consolidation range, even maintaining strength above earlier structural zones that previously acted as deeper support. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Technical Road to $6.90 Hov’s projection is grounded in clear market logic. A confirmed breakout above $3.25 would signify the transition from compression to expansion, validating bullish control. Historically, when assets break from such tightly wound structures in a confirmed wave three, momentum often compounds quickly as both traders and algorithms recognize the shift. The target of $6.90 stems from Fibonacci wave measurements that quantify potential extensions based on earlier impulse lengths. Within this framework, a rapid price acceleration is not speculative — it’s mathematically consistent with prior patterns observed in XRP and other assets undergoing third-wave expansions. Balancing Momentum with Market Caution While the technical outlook is bullish, Hov maintains a measured perspective. Failure to achieve a sustained break above $3.25 could keep XRP trapped in its sideways pattern a while longer. Broader macroeconomic factors and liquidity trends also play a role; shifts in investor sentiment or unexpected regulatory commentary could either accelerate or delay the breakout phase. Ripple’s completed legal battle with the U.S. SEC has reduced structural risk and improved investor confidence, allowing XRP to trade with a more stable footing. That stability provides the foundation for a possible resurgence once the market confirms direction. XRP’s chart is at a moment of equilibrium — pressure building, structure tightening, and momentum waiting to ignite. Hov’s Elliott Wave projection provides a clear technical roadmap: a decisive close above $3.25 could trigger a powerful surge toward $6.90, while failure to confirm the breakout may prolong consolidation. For now, XRP’s resilience and technical precision suggest that the next major move may not be far away. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Accordingly, BNB left behind Tether (USDT) and XRP with a remarkable performance. As the BNB rally continues, BNB has moved into third place in terms of market capitalization, leaving behind XRP and USDT. BNB, which broke a new record of $1,283 on the Binance USDT spot market, has risen to approximately $178.9 billion in market value, according to CoinMarketCap data. According to the latest changes, BNB rose to the 3rd place among the largest cryptocurrencies, while XRP fell to the 4th place. Meanwhile, Tether (USDT) fell to 5th place, just behind XRP. It is estimated that this rise in BNB, which broke a new record by exceeding $1,100 in the past weeks, is due to increased buying pressure in futures transactions and rumors that more spot BNB ETF applications are coming. According to Coinglass data, BNB futures open interest continues to rise, while short positions broke a record in the last hour. BNB led the way with the most short liquidations, with $1.64 million liquidated in the last hour. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Top 10 Cryptocurrency Ranking Changes!

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/polkadot-price-prediction/",
        "body": "Key takeaways In 2025, Polkadot might reach a maximum price value of $4.92 and an average value of $4.58. In 2028, the DOT price is expected to range from a maximum of $15.81 to a minimum of $13.00. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $48.15 in 2031. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong multichain protocol architecture, which ensures network security—and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on the Acala Network, which enhances functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility, contributing to its substantial market capitalization. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2025-2031.

Breakout Potential The tight range suggests momentum is building for a move above $4.43 toward $4.60. Rising optimism and improving market sentiment support Polkadot’s steady recovery and growing bullish outlook. As of October 7, 2025, Polkadot (DOT) is trading at $4.30, showing a 2.91% gain in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has displayed a positive momentum, recovering from its lower range and maintaining stability above the $4.20 mark. The key resistance levels are noted at $4.43, while support remains firm at $4.18, signaling a steady trading channel. DOT’s price behavior indicates renewed optimism among traders as it continues to hold within a short-term bullish zone. The recovery coincides with improving sentiment across the broader crypto market, supporting Polkadot’s upward movement. Polkadot 1-day price chart: DOT building strength above support The daily chart reveals that Polkadot is forming a gradual bullish structure as it trades above its key support at $4.18. The recent bounce toward $4.30 suggests buyers are defending lower levels effectively, showing resilience in the current market setup. DOT remains positioned near its short-term moving averages, indicating that a bullish trend is beginning to outweigh selling momentum. A clear breakout above $4.43 could validate this strength, potentially opening the path for a move toward the $4.60–$4.70 range. DOT/USDT Price Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around the neutral zone, reflecting balanced conditions with a slight bullish tilt. The MACD line indicates convergence, suggesting a potential continuation of the upward trend if volume increases. However, failure to sustain above the critical support at $4.25 could invite short-term corrections. Back to the $4.18 support. For now, DOT’s daily trend structure suggests consolidation within a narrow range, with momentum gradually shifting in favor of buyers. Polkadot 4-hour price chart: DOT consolidation before a breakout On the 4-hour timeframe, Polkadot is consolidating tightly between $4.18 and $4.43, forming a short-term symmetrical structure that reflects indecision among traders. The price has repeatedly tested both the upper and lower bounds, confirming the significance of these levels as immediate barriers to further movement in the upcoming parachain auctions. The short-term moving averages are aligning closely, indicating that a breakout may be approaching. A confirmed close above $4.43 could lead to increased momentum, while a dip below $4.18 might trigger minor pullbacks toward $4.10. DOT/USDT Price Chart: TradingView The RSI remains mid-range, suggesting that DOT still has room to rise before becoming overbought. Trading volume has remained steady, suggesting accumulation during this consolidation phase. Traders are closely watching for a decisive move supported by substantial volume to determine the next directional shift. If bullish pressure persists, DOT could break out of its current pattern, signaling renewed upward momentum in the short term.

Polkadot’s steady performance above $4.20 suggests that the expected average trading price indicates the current bullish momentum may continue. If buying pressure holds. A breakout above the $4.43 resistance could pave the way toward $4.60 or higher, confirming renewed market confidence. However, if DOT fails to sustain above $4.25, a short-term pullback toward $4.18 remains possible before the next upward attempt. Overall, as long as DOT maintains support above $4.20, the near-term price action favors gradual gains. And a potential continuation of its recovery trend. Is Polkadot a good investment? Polkadot continues to show resilience, maintaining solid support and attracting steady investor interest. Its long-term potential lies in its strong ecosystem and innovative multichain technology, which enables seamless interoperability between blockchains. As the network expands with new parachain developments and DeFi integrations, DOT’s utility and demand are expected to grow. In the short term, DOT’s performance will depend on broader market conditions and its ability to hold above key support levels. For long-term investors, Polkadot remains a promising project with strong fundamentals, though patience and awareness of market volatility are essential. Why is Polkadot up today? Polkadot’s recent price increase can be attributed to a combination of improving market sentiment and renewed buying interest across major cryptocurrencies. The broader cryptocurrency market recovery has strengthened investor confidence, prompting accumulation near key support levels as some anticipate a new all-time high. Additionally, Polkadot’s consistent network growth and rising activity within its parachain ecosystem are reinforcing optimism among traders in the broader blockchain ecosystem. These factors, along with steady technical support above $4.20, have fueled the current bullish momentum and lifted DOT’s price toward the $4.30 range.

        "body": "Bitcoin traded near $124,900 this week after comments from Telegram founder Pavel Durov drew attention back to its long-term potential. Speaking on the Lex Fridman Podcast, Durov said he believes Bitcoin could eventually reach $1 million per coin, citing its fixed supply and independence from government control as key advantages. His remarks come at a time when investors are reassessing Bitcoin’s role as an alternative to inflation-prone fiat currencies. Scarcity and Early Conviction Drive Bullish Outlook Durov said he became an early Bitcoin investor in 2013, buying several thousand coins at around $700 each. Even after steep market declines — including a drop below $200 — he chose to hold, describing Bitcoin as “digital gold.” He said its appeal lies in its independence: no central authority can seize or censor it, and its supply is permanently limited to 21 million coins. This scarcity remains central to Bitcoin’s value proposition. Increasingly, institutional investors share this view, treating BTC as a hedge against monetary expansion and weakening fiat currencies. Durov’s experience illustrates that perspective. He credits his Bitcoin holdings, rather than Telegram’s profits, for giving him the freedom to operate globally and independently. This position reinforces why many see Bitcoin as more than a speculative asset. Macro Trends Support the $1 Million Thesis Durov linked his $1 million Bitcoin projection to broader economic forces, particularly the long-term effects of expansive monetary policy. He argued that as governments continue to increase money supply to manage debt and stimulate growth, assets with fixed supply — like Bitcoin — stand to benefit. “I think this is how money should work,” he said. “Nobody can confiscate your Bitcoin, and nobody can censor you for political reasons.” Here's my 4+ hour conversation with Pavel Durov ( @durov ), founder and CEO of Telegram. This was one of the most fascinating and powerful conversations I've ever had in my life. We discuss everything from his philosophy on freedom to government bureaucracies, intelligence… pic.twitter.com/DDBTnE7A2t — Lex Fridman (@lexfridman) September 30, 2025 His view aligns with a growing sentiment among investors who see Bitcoin as a safeguard against currency erosion. With inflation pressures persisting and global debt levels rising, Bitcoin’s decentralized and finite structure provides a contrast to traditional systems that rely on central banks. Market reaction to Durov’s comments has been steady. Bitcoin’s ability to hold above $124,000 reflects continued institutional demand, despite short-term volatility persisting. For many, his remarks reinforce a longer-term narrative: that Bitcoin’s value is increasingly tied to its role as a counterweight to monetary excess rather than a short-lived speculative cycle. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Bearish Butterfly Nears Reversal Zone On the technical front , Bitcoin remains firmly in an uptrend, with price action continuing to follow the rising trendline that has defined October’s advance. The structure of higher highs and higher lows points to steady accumulation, while the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages — at $114,186 and $107,586 — provide clear dynamic support beneath the market. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The chart shows a Bearish Butterfly harmonic pattern approaching its Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) between $128,000 and $130,000. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) near 73 signals mildly overbought conditions, hinting at a short-term pause or pullback before any renewed push higher. As long as Bitcoin holds above $124,600, a move toward the $130,000 area remains likely. A clean breakout beyond that range would invalidate the bearish setup and potentially open a path toward $160,000 in the medium term. #Bitcoin consolidates near $125K as the Bearish Butterfly pattern nears its reversal zone at $128K–$130K. RSI hovers near 73, signaling short-term caution but sustained strength. A breakout above $130K could invalidate the pattern and open the path toward $160K. pic.twitter.com/ID1288MTiZ — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 7, 2025 At this stage, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above key support levels suggests consolidation rather than exhaustion. Combined with growing institutional inflows and renewed market optimism following Durov’s remarks, the broader outlook for Q4 2025 remains skewed to the upside.

        "url": "https://cryptonews.com/news/bnb-hits-second-ath-this-month-crosses-1300-barrier-is-1500-next/",
        "body": "Binance Coin ( BNB ) surged past $1,300 on October 6, 2025, marking its second all-time high within hours after initially breaking $1,200 earlier in the day, as the token flipped XRP to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Source: TradingVew The 19% weekly gain boosted BNB’s market cap to over $154 billion, surpassing both Tether and XRP behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. BNB Chain topped all blockchains in 24-hour fees, followed closely by Hyperledger and Solana. The rally coincided with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high above $126,000, as the ongoing US government shutdown drove investors to cryptocurrencies as safe-haven assets. Founder Changpeng Zhao emphasized ecosystem growth, with 30% of BNB’s supply now staked amid institutional inflows and the expansion of DeFi. The surge comes as October historically delivers a strong fourth-quarter performance for cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin averaging 79.6% gains in past Q4 periods. JUST IN: $BNB reaches new ATH of $1,300 pic.twitter.com/wVvWHElltX — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) October 7, 2025 CZ Admits Preferring X Over Binance Square Despite BNB Rally Amid these wild runs towards new ATHs, Changpeng Zhao admitted he personally prefers using X over Binance’s own social platform, Binance Square, despite the latter reaching 275 million users since launching in 2023. CZ cited security concerns as the primary reason, stating he likes to “ stay logged out on Binance.com when not making a transaction ” and can go months without logging in. He noted he uses X to reach the “non-Binance community” as the center of broader crypto discourse. There are a few reasons I use X more than Binance Square. I like to stay logged out on https://t.co/9rMMAmczvH when not making a transaction, as a security policy. I go on for months without logging in. I like to reach non Binance community. But maybe I will switch back there https://t.co/A2Jsltrsqb — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 4, 2025 The comments received mixed reactions, with critics questioning why the founder would not be active in his own ecosystem. The contrast with Elon Musk’s frequent posting on X since acquiring Twitter in 2022 stands out sharply. CZ concluded by saying he will “ maybe ” switch back to Binance Square in the future. Broader Market Rally Driven by Political Uncertainty and Institutional Demand Bitcoin’s surge past $126,000 was accompanied by over $1 billion in spot ETF inflows , including nearly $970 million from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, with trading volume up more than 20% from the prior day. Analysts attribute the rally to the April halving, pro-crypto policies under the Trump administration, and Bitcoin’s appeal amid the political uncertainty caused by the government shutdown. Just yesterday, Strategy Inc. reported a $3.9 billion unrealized gain on its 640,031 BTC holdings in the third quarter, with total fair value reaching $47.35 billion. Earlier today, VanEck’s Matthew Sigel stated that surveys indicate younger consumers are increasingly favoring Bitcoin for wealth preservation over gold. He noted that around half of gold’s market value comes from its store of value role, and if Bitcoin captured half of that market, it would imply $644,000 per coin at today’s record gold price. We’ve been saying Bitcoin should reach half of gold’s market cap after the next halving. Roughly half of gold’s value reflects its use as a store of value rather than industrial or jewelry demand, and surveys show younger consumers in emerging markets increasingly prefer Bitcoin… — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) October 7, 2025 VanEck projects that Bitcoin could settle 10% of global trade by 2050, supporting a long-term price of $2.9 million per coin, equivalent to a $61 trillion market capitalization. Technical Analysis Projects $1,500 Target Following Breakout Pattern Hourly chart analysis reveals BNB trading at $1,266.83 following a breakout from consolidation near $1,193, with upside targets of approximately $1,347 representing a 6.3% gain. Source: X/@Tryrexcrypto Conversely, downside risk lies below $1,183, which would result in a potential 6.6% decline. The consolidation box around $1,193 represents the base from which the recent advance developed, with a relatively balanced risk-reward ratio suggesting a current equilibrium between buyers and sellers. To take it even further, daily chart analysis identifies three distinct phases of breakout. The first, from a $650 to $700 base, yields 27% gains, the second, from a $850 consolidation, yields 29% gains, and projections suggest the current third breakout could produce 51% gains, reaching $1,500. $BNB is repeating its perfect rhythm. First breakout gave 27% Second breakout gave 29% Now the third one is in play with a clear target near $1500, around 51% higher. The trend speaks for itself. Don’t overthink it. pic.twitter.com/66QTb8y6LI — Crypto King (@CryptoKing4Ever) October 7, 2025 However, the pattern of escalating percentage gains assumes unlimited buying power and ignores profit-taking dynamics that typically emerge after substantial advances. BNB has already delivered over 100% gains from recent bases around $600. The $1,500 target represents approximately 18.5% upside from current levels around $1,266, requiring BNB’s market capitalization to reach above $208 billion and entirely surpass XRP and USDT to solidify its position as the third-largest digital asset. The rally didn’t start overnight; BNB has recorded a price increase of over 99% in the past three months. Some analysts believe FOMO could push BNB toward $1,500 as the next psychological target, although ecosystem developments and treasury buying may already be reflected in current valuations. As it stands now, BNB could continue toward $1,400-$1,500 if momentum extends, although consolidation between $1,200-$1,350 appears more likely as markets digest recent 100%+ gains from $600 bases. A potential correction toward $1,100-$1,150 remains possible if profit-taking accelerates following the all-time high breakout, as the hourly chart’s balanced risk parameters contradict aggressive longer-term projections.

        "body": "Chainlink’s token, LINK, is riding a new wave of optimism after breaking through the $22.75 resistance mark, fueled by fresh partnerships and renewed investor confidence. The price surge follows BNB Chain’s integration of Chainlink’s data oracles to bring verified US economic data on-chain, a move that strengthens the project’s role at the heart of blockchain-based financial infrastructure. The integration has helped ignite a sharp rebound in LINK’s price, lifting it 3.2% in the past 24 hours to a daily high of $23.67 on CoinMarketCap , outpacing the broader crypto market’s 0.73% gain. Notably, this comes as Bitcoin (BTC) hit a fresh all-time high (ATH) of $126,198.07, setting an upbeat tone across digital assets. BNB partnership gives Chainlink new real-world reach The collaboration between BNB Chain and Chainlink marks a turning point for decentralised data infrastructure. Through Chainlink’s Data Standard, real-time statistics from the US Department of Commerce and the Bureau of Economic Analysis — such as GDP, the PCE Price Index, and Real Final Sales — are now accessible directly on-chain. This integration allows developers to build decentralised finance (DeFi) products that respond to verified economic data rather than third-party estimates. The move transforms how smart contracts interact with the real world. Developers can now design inflation-linked tokens, GDP-based derivatives, and risk models that mirror actual macroeconomic conditions. The integration also expands Chainlink’s influence beyond technical oracles into a bridge between global economies and DeFi. It also positions Chainlink as a critical layer for the growing tokenised real-world asset (RAW) market, projected to exceed $30 trillion in value. Technical breakout fuels investor confidence On the charts, LINK’s technical setup has turned decisively bullish. After weeks of consolidation under pressure, the token has broken out of a “cup and handle” formation and is now completing a bullish flag pattern. The breakout above $22.75 signals the start of a potential continuation rally, with short-term resistance targets sitting at $24.63 and $25.93. If momentum holds, the next major resistance lies at $27.32, a price region that could pave the way toward the long-term psychological target near $30, according to market analysts . Analysts note that LINK’s seven-day simple moving average recently crossed above its 30-day counterpart, a pattern often viewed as a bullish confirmation. Source: CoinMarketCap On-chain data also shows mixed signals, as a large holder reportedly sold 700,000 LINK at a loss earlier this week, suggesting mild profit-taking as prices climb. Beyond the current price rally, Chainlink’s role in bringing verified government and financial data to blockchain networks is viewed as a foundational step for the next phase of DeFi maturity. By securing partnerships with Binance’s BNB Chain, ICE, and Mastercard, Chainlink (LINK) is strengthening its position as the backbone of data reliability in Web3 ecosystems.

        "body": "Dubai, UAE, October 7th, 2025, Chainwire Pepeto , an Ethereum-based meme coin project, has raised over $6.93 million during its ongoing presale. The token is currently offered at a fixed presale price of $0.000000157, with a total supply of 420 trillion—mirroring PEPE’s tokenomics. As part of its early-stage development, Pepeto has launched a demo version of its decentralized exchange, PepetoSwap, and is building a cross-chain bridge to support liquidity and interoperability. The project also offers staking at a 222% APY, aimed at rewarding participants during the presale phase. BNB Market Update: $1,244 Price, $173B Market Cap, and Q4 Outlook BNB is trading at $1,244.17 with a market capitalization of $173.17 billion, continuing an upward trend after breaking out of a flag pattern and retesting the $1,000 level as support. Analysts highlight consolidation near the $1,200 mark, with identified technical levels between $1,300 and $1,350. Market attention remains focused on the ongoing competition between Binance and Coinbase as Q4 unfolds. Ethereum ATH Metrics and BNB Scarcity Consideration Ethereum (ETH), created by Vitalik Buterin, is currently priced at $4,714.63 and nearing its previous all-time high of $4,900. On a return basis, ETH offers limited room for short-term gains at current levels. In contrast, a token such as BNB, if priced against ETH’s historical highs, would mathematically reflect a higher return multiple due to its current market price. BNB’s circulating supply of approximately 139.18 million is often cited in discussions around long-term scarcity. Meme Coin Market Overview: PEPE, SHIB, and DOGE PEPE is trading at $0.00001020, with a prior ATH of $0.00002479. SHIB stands at $0.00001282, close to its peak of $0.00001283. DOGE is priced at $0.2667, with a previous high near $0.57. These tokens each exhibit distinct market trajectories and historical volatility profiles. Community Commentary and Project Narrative Online discussions around Pepeto have drawn comparisons to PEPE, with some community members referencing a reported shift in direction by a former contributor associated with the original “TO” (Technology and Optimization) concept. While such claims remain unverified, the Pepeto project has received attention for launching products during the presale and pursuing infrastructure development. Pepeto Project Highlights PepetoSwap Demo Exchange : Live during the presale, enabling early access to the platform’s trading interface.

As the BNB rally continues, BNB has moved into third place in terms of market capitalization, leaving behind XRP and USDT. BNB, which broke a new record of $1,283 on the Binance USDT spot market, has risen to approximately $178.9 billion in market value, according to CoinMarketCap data.

According to Coinglass data, BNB futures open interest continues to rise, while short positions broke a record in the last hour.
