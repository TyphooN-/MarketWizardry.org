        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/",
        "body": "Key Takeaways: Our Ordinals price prediction anticipates a high of $29.81 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $8 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $8.32 Market cap $174.77M 24-hour trading volume $38.73M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2024 24-hour high $8.95 24-hour low $8.18 Ordi price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 8.87% 50-day SMA $9.05 200-day SMA $9.34 Sentiment Bearish Green days 16/30 (53%) Fear and Greed Index 71 (Greed) Ordi price analysis On the day of writing (October 4), ORDI’s price dropped by 5.51% in 24 hours and 0.11% in the last seven days. Its trading volume dropped by 17.16% showing less trader conviction in the market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades along the Williams alligator trendlines, signaling an uneventful market as the price bounced off support levels ($7.70 Fibonacci midpoint) and key moving averages. The coin has registered negative momentum in the last 7 days. The MACD and signal lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, signaling a bear market. At the same time, the relative strength index is in neutral territory at 44.51. It is oversold when the RSI falls below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI is moving sideways at the $8.39 mark with MACD confirmation (-0.029). The William Alligator trendlines show falling volatility. ORDI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 8.69 SELL SMA 5 8.40 SELL SMA 10 8.46 SELL SMA 21 9.09 SELL SMA 50 9.05 SELL SMA 100 9.17 SELL SMA 200 9.34 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 8.78 SELL EMA 5 8.85 SELL EMA 10 8.91 SELL EMA 21 9.05 SELL EMA 50 9.17 SELL EMA 100 9.38 SELL EMA 200 11.87 SELL What to expect from ORDI price analysis next? ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. Over the short term, ORDI remains correlated with Bitcoin, which is just below $122,000. The charts show it will continue downwards but with less volatility. Why is ORDI down? ORDI’s drop reflects technical triggers, Bitcoin-driven risk aversion, and technical overextension. Its status as a “Bitcoin beta” leaves it exposed during dominance rallies, while thin liquidity magnifies moves. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10. In October, it traded above the $8 mark.",

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-high-can-ethereum-eth-go-this-uptober-chatgpt-breaks-it-down-and-names-a-cheaper-must-buy-crypto-for-2025/",
        "body": "The Uptober month is already living up to its name, with Ethereum (ETH) returning to the limelight as specialists foresee a possible breakout higher than $5,000, and as high as $5,500. More institutional inflows, optimism regarding the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, and higher Layer-2 adoption are all helping to create bullish momentum for the world’s second-largest altcoin. But while ETH’s potential upside remains strong, investors are becoming more interested in a much more high-upside play, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with far greater growth potential at a fraction of the expense. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance has been one of the most popular DeFi projects in 2025 with its twin lending infrastructure, real-yield mechanics, and non-custodial smart contracts tackling critical inefficiencies of decentralized finance. With Stage 6 of its presale over 55% sold out, 16,750+ holders, and over $16.8 million raised, MUTM could outshine ETH in the next run. Ethereum (ETH) Positions Itself for a Strong Uptober Rally Ethereum (ETH) is positioning itself for a potential explosive rally in October 2025, with prices keeping their strength around $4,300 after a steep bounce above $4,000. October, which is known as “Uptober” among traders, historically comes with average returns of nearly 5%, and this time the setup looks even stronger. Institutional demand is increasing as ETH investment funds attract hundreds of millions of inflows, with big players such as BlackRock ongoing in developing its network. At the same time, 30% of the ETH supply is now staked, locking up coins and removing circulating supply from the network, as deflationary token burns further tighten market dynamics. With exhausted exchange reserves, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the bullish BTC trend, and greater crypto euphoria around key U.S. events, analysts say that a breakout above $5,000 is eminently within the realm of possibility. But although ETH displays dazzling upside, the vast majority of investors seeking greater growth potential are starting to eye Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for out-of-proportion returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge as Investor Frenzy Hits All-Time High Mutuum Finance has been providing early adopters with the special opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a lower cost before the project is officially launched. Phase 6 tokens available at $0.035 have been extremely sought after, presale already reaching over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 owners. The figures say volumes of active market enthusiasm and increasing faith in the future of the long-term business. Besides locking down the platform and engaging with community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program with an official $50,000 USDT bug bounty pool. The program invites white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to report codebase vulnerabilities with rewards paid out depending on severity. This ensures that even the minor problems are addressed as quickly as possible and general platform security is high. Mutuum Finance to Roll Out New DeFi Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has announced the upcoming release of its own lending and borrowing protocol , a giant leap towards decentralized finance. The V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have the fundamental components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Since ETH and USDT are supported from the start for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing, the platform aims to offer a stable and scalable foundation for users of DeFi. To access recent and real-time prices, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles along with high-cap token feeds like USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references are provided, which allow multi-layered functionality to supply robust and secure price data in the face of ultra-abnormal market chaos. Ethereum’s “Uptober” rally may propel ETH to over $5,000, yet its potential is capped compared to the early-stage possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at only $0.035 is already more than 55% sold in phase 6 with $16.8M raised, presents much greater growth potential. Its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield structure, and robust presale traction make MUTM the top DeFi altcoin for investors seeking disproportionate 2025 returns.

Bitcoin’s increasing institutional adoption and improving regulatory clarity create a favorable environment for mining operations. Additionally, the upcoming halving cycles historically correlate with significant price appreciation, potentially amplifying mining returns. Professional mining services allow you to participate in this growth without the technical complexities. As energy costs rise globally, individual mining becomes increasingly impractical, while professional operations benefit from economies of scale and renewable energy sources. This approach ensures sustainable and profitable operations that individual miners simply cannot match. The crypto market’s maturation also means more sophisticated investors are looking for reliable passive income streams. Mining provides this opportunity without the volatility of trading or the complexity of DeFi protocols.

        "body": "The Uptober month is already living up to its name, with Ethereum (ETH) returning to the limelight as specialists foresee a possible breakout higher than $5,000, and as high as $5,500. More institutional inflows, optimism regarding the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, and higher Layer-2 adoption are all helping to create bullish momentum for the world’s second-largest altcoin. But while ETH’s potential upside remains strong, investors are becoming more interested in a much more high-upside play, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with far greater growth potential at a fraction of the expense. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance has been one of the most popular DeFi projects in 2025 with its twin lending infrastructure, real-yield mechanics, and non-custodial smart contracts tackling critical inefficiencies of decentralized finance. With Stage 6 of its presale over 55% sold out, 16,750+ holders, and over $16.8 million raised, MUTM could outshine ETH in the next run. Ethereum (ETH) Positions Itself for a Strong Uptober Rally Ethereum (ETH) is positioning itself for a potential explosive rally in October 2025, with prices keeping their strength around $4,300 after a steep bounce above $4,000. October, which is known as “Uptober” among traders, historically comes with average returns of nearly 5%, and this time the setup looks even stronger. Institutional demand is increasing as ETH investment funds attract hundreds of millions of inflows, with big players such as BlackRock ongoing in developing its network. At the same time, 30% of the ETH supply is now staked, locking up coins and removing circulating supply from the network, as deflationary token burns further tighten market dynamics. With exhausted exchange reserves, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the bullish BTC trend, and greater crypto euphoria around key U.S. events, analysts say that a breakout above $5,000 is eminently within the realm of possibility. But although ETH displays dazzling upside, the vast majority of investors seeking greater growth potential are starting to eye Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for out-of-proportion returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge as Investor Frenzy Hits All-Time High Mutuum Finance has been providing early adopters with the special opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a lower cost before the project is officially launched. Phase 6 tokens available at $0.035 have been extremely sought after, presale already reaching over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 owners. The figures say volumes of active market enthusiasm and increasing faith in the future of the long-term business. Besides locking down the platform and engaging with community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program with an official $50,000 USDT bug bounty pool. The program invites white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to report codebase vulnerabilities with rewards paid out depending on severity. This ensures that even the minor problems are addressed as quickly as possible and general platform security is high. Mutuum Finance to Roll Out New DeFi Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has announced the upcoming release of its own lending and borrowing protocol , a giant leap towards decentralized finance. The V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have the fundamental components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Since ETH and USDT are supported from the start for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing, the platform aims to offer a stable and scalable foundation for users of DeFi. To access recent and real-time prices, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles along with high-cap token feeds like USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references are provided, which allow multi-layered functionality to supply robust and secure price data in the face of ultra-abnormal market chaos. Ethereum’s “Uptober” rally may propel ETH to over $5,000, yet its potential is capped compared to the early-stage possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at only $0.035 is already more than 55% sold in phase 6 with $16.8M raised, presents much greater growth potential. Its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield structure, and robust presale traction make MUTM the top DeFi altcoin for investors seeking disproportionate 2025 returns.

        "body": "Ethereum’s steward moved part of its crypto coffers this week, converting a chunk of ETH into stablecoins as it adjusts how it funds projects and grants. Foundation Moves To Stablecoin Holdings According to reports, the Ethereum Foundation converted 1,000 ETH into stablecoins using the decentralized trading router CoW Swap, a transaction worth about $4.5 million at the time. The move was executed as part of the foundation’s ongoing treasury actions and was presented as a step to secure more predictable funds for research, grants, and donations. The specific stablecoin or coins received in exchange were not publicly named in initial reports. The Foundation’s treasurer has been managing a broader plan. Reports have disclosed a previously stated intention to convert up to 10,000 Ether over a period of weeks, and this latest trade appears to be an element of that phased approach rather than a one-off sale. Holding stable assets gives the foundation a clearer view of its short-term spending power while it evaluates longer-term strategy. 1/ Today, The Ethereum Foundation will convert 1000 ETH to stablecoins via @CoWSwap ‘s TWAP feature, as part of our ongoing work to fund R&D, grants and donations, and to highlight the power of DeFi. — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) October 3, 2025 Use Of Decentralized Trading Tools The choice to use CoW Swap — a decentralized aggregator that aims to reduce slippage and market impact — was highlighted in public coverage. By routing the trade through decentralized infrastructure instead of a single centralized exchange, the Foundation reduced some counterparty and custody concerns. The execution method was described as careful and aimed at protecting the value of the sale during the swap. Alongside the transaction, internal operational decisions have also been articulated. The Foundation indicated it temporarily applied the breaks on open submissions of a grant for its Ecosystem Support Program in order to give attention to the large influx of proposals and prioritize urgent or high-impact work. Changes in leadership and institutional reorganization, have also been discussed publicly as part of recent organizational action, portrayed in a manner that suggests a transition is underway internally to accompany any change in the direction of treasury management as well. What Comes Next For The Treasury Market watchers noted that converting ETH to stablecoins is a common liquidity-management tactic. Volatility in ETH’s price can make budgeting for multi-month support programs difficult; stable assets can smooth out planning. While some community members saw the sale as a reduction of ETH holdings, others pointed out that the foundation’s core mission — to support Ethereum’s development — remains unchanged.

        "url": "https://timestabloid.com/heres-what-xrp-market-cap-multiplier-effect-means/",
        "body": "Every crypto bull market has its buzzwords, but few have sparked as much curiosity among XRP holders as the so-called “market cap multiplier effect.” It’s the idea that XRP’s true price potential isn’t limited by its large total supply — because only a fraction of that supply is actively available on the market. In other words, XRP’s liquidity reality may be far smaller than its theoretical supply, meaning smaller inflows of capital could trigger disproportionately large price reactions. Understanding the Market Cap Multiplier In a recent video, Jake Claver, managing partner at Digital Wealth Partners, tackled the growing debate head-on: “People look at total supply of XRP when, in reality, the supply-demand dynamics are going to be on the available supply of XRP,” he explained. This distinction — between XRP’s total supply of 100 billion and the much smaller circulating amount that actually trades — is at the heart of the multiplier effect. Let's look at what the XRP market cap multiplier effect means pic.twitter.com/5tiUdpHt6i — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) October 3, 2025 Claver illustrated this with a practical example: “There might be 2 billion XRP left on exchanges — probably less than that if you include retail and what they’re going to exit or sell.” He added that even if XRP’s price skyrockets to $10, $20, or even $50, some retail investors would inevitably sell portions of their holdings, adding perhaps another billion XRP to the liquid market. But that still represents a small share of total supply. The Math Behind the Multiplier Claver broke down the logic simply: “If you only had, let’s say, 2 billion [XRP] out of 100 billion, you’d be that 50x that Zach Rector talks about. It’s total supply versus available supply — and that’s why you get a shift in how much liquidity moving in is going to cause the market cap to rise in a multiplier effect.” When buyers enter the market, their demand impacts a smaller pool of available tokens, rather than the total supply. This limited float magnifies price movements, which in turn amplifies market capitalization faster than would occur in a fully distributed asset. Institutional Holdings and Market Liquidity Claver also revealed that his firm, Digital Wealth Partners, currently manages around 200 million XRP, accounting for roughly 8% of retail-owned XRP, based on his estimates. This institutional custody further concentrates holdings, reducing the amount of XRP readily available on exchanges. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 “Retail doesn’t hold more than maybe 1.2 to 2 billion total XRP in my opinion,” he said, emphasizing that these liquidity dynamics are critical for understanding XRP’s future price behavior. Broader Context and Implications While the multiplier concept doesn’t change XRP’s total supply — which remains capped at 100 billion — it reframes how market participants should interpret liquidity and price discovery. Ripple’s monthly escrow releases , typically capped at 1 billion XRP, also control how much new supply enters circulation, keeping active liquidity relatively tight. The takeaway is clear: XRP’s potential price response is not purely a function of total supply, but of how much XRP is actually tradable. As Claver summarized, “It’s total supply versus available supply. That’s the reason there is a multiplier effect.” The XRP market cap multiplier effect shows how small changes in liquidity can lead to significant price movements. It’s not speculation — it’s a structural feature of how XRP trades in real-world conditions, where limited availability magnifies every dollar of demand that flows into the asset.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/",
        "body": "Key Takeaways: Our Ordinals price prediction anticipates a high of $29.81 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $8 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $8.32 Market cap $174.77M 24-hour trading volume $38.73M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2024 24-hour high $8.95 24-hour low $8.18 Ordi price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 8.87% 50-day SMA $9.05 200-day SMA $9.34 Sentiment Bearish Green days 16/30 (53%) Fear and Greed Index 71 (Greed) Ordi price analysis On the day of writing (October 4), ORDI’s price dropped by 5.51% in 24 hours and 0.11% in the last seven days. Its trading volume dropped by 17.16% showing less trader conviction in the market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades along the Williams alligator trendlines, signaling an uneventful market as the price bounced off support levels ($7.70 Fibonacci midpoint) and key moving averages. The coin has registered negative momentum in the last 7 days. The MACD and signal lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, signaling a bear market. At the same time, the relative strength index is in neutral territory at 44.51. It is oversold when the RSI falls below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI is moving sideways at the $8.39 mark with MACD confirmation (-0.029). The William Alligator trendlines show falling volatility. ORDI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 8.69 SELL SMA 5 8.40 SELL SMA 10 8.46 SELL SMA 21 9.09 SELL SMA 50 9.05 SELL SMA 100 9.17 SELL SMA 200 9.34 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 8.78 SELL EMA 5 8.85 SELL EMA 10 8.91 SELL EMA 21 9.05 SELL EMA 50 9.17 SELL EMA 100 9.38 SELL EMA 200 11.87 SELL What to expect from ORDI price analysis next? ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. Over the short term, ORDI remains correlated with Bitcoin, which is just below $122,000. The charts show it will continue downwards but with less volatility. Why is ORDI down? ORDI’s drop reflects technical triggers, Bitcoin-driven risk aversion, and technical overextension. Its status as a “Bitcoin beta” leaves it exposed during dominance rallies, while thin liquidity magnifies moves. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come. Ordinals price prediction October 2025 The Ordinals forecast for October is a maximum price of $9.40 and a minimum price of $7.25. The average trading price will be $8.94.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10. In October, it traded above the $8 mark.",

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-high-can-ethereum-eth-go-this-uptober-chatgpt-breaks-it-down-and-names-a-cheaper-must-buy-crypto-for-2025/",
        "body": "The Uptober month is already living up to its name, with Ethereum (ETH) returning to the limelight as specialists foresee a possible breakout higher than $5,000, and as high as $5,500. More institutional inflows, optimism regarding the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, and higher Layer-2 adoption are all helping to create bullish momentum for the world’s second-largest altcoin. But while ETH’s potential upside remains strong, investors are becoming more interested in a much more high-upside play, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with far greater growth potential at a fraction of the expense. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance has been one of the most popular DeFi projects in 2025 with its twin lending infrastructure, real-yield mechanics, and non-custodial smart contracts tackling critical inefficiencies of decentralized finance. With Stage 6 of its presale over 55% sold out, 16,750+ holders, and over $16.8 million raised, MUTM could outshine ETH in the next run. Ethereum (ETH) Positions Itself for a Strong Uptober Rally Ethereum (ETH) is positioning itself for a potential explosive rally in October 2025, with prices keeping their strength around $4,300 after a steep bounce above $4,000. October, which is known as “Uptober” among traders, historically comes with average returns of nearly 5%, and this time the setup looks even stronger. Institutional demand is increasing as ETH investment funds attract hundreds of millions of inflows, with big players such as BlackRock ongoing in developing its network. At the same time, 30% of the ETH supply is now staked, locking up coins and removing circulating supply from the network, as deflationary token burns further tighten market dynamics. With exhausted exchange reserves, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the bullish BTC trend, and greater crypto euphoria around key U.S. events, analysts say that a breakout above $5,000 is eminently within the realm of possibility. But although ETH displays dazzling upside, the vast majority of investors seeking greater growth potential are starting to eye Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for out-of-proportion returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge as Investor Frenzy Hits All-Time High Mutuum Finance has been providing early adopters with the special opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a lower cost before the project is officially launched. Phase 6 tokens available at $0.035 have been extremely sought after, presale already reaching over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 owners. The figures say volumes of active market enthusiasm and increasing faith in the future of the long-term business. Besides locking down the platform and engaging with community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program with an official $50,000 USDT bug bounty pool. The program invites white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to report codebase vulnerabilities with rewards paid out depending on severity. This ensures that even the minor problems are addressed as quickly as possible and general platform security is high. Mutuum Finance to Roll Out New DeFi Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has announced the upcoming release of its own lending and borrowing protocol , a giant leap towards decentralized finance. The V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have the fundamental components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Since ETH and USDT are supported from the start for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing, the platform aims to offer a stable and scalable foundation for users of DeFi. To access recent and real-time prices, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles along with high-cap token feeds like USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references are provided, which allow multi-layered functionality to supply robust and secure price data in the face of ultra-abnormal market chaos. Ethereum’s “Uptober” rally may propel ETH to over $5,000, yet its potential is capped compared to the early-stage possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at only $0.035 is already more than 55% sold in phase 6 with $16.8M raised, presents much greater growth potential. Its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield structure, and robust presale traction make MUTM the top DeFi altcoin for investors seeking disproportionate 2025 returns.

Bitcoin’s increasing institutional adoption and improving regulatory clarity create a favorable environment for mining operations. Additionally, the upcoming halving cycles historically correlate with significant price appreciation, potentially amplifying mining returns. Professional mining services allow you to participate in this growth without the technical complexities. As energy costs rise globally, individual mining becomes increasingly impractical, while professional operations benefit from economies of scale and renewable energy sources. This approach ensures sustainable and profitable operations that individual miners simply cannot match. The crypto market’s maturation also means more sophisticated investors are looking for reliable passive income streams. Mining provides this opportunity without the volatility of trading or the complexity of DeFi protocols.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/arbitrum-price-prediction/",
        "body": "Key takeaways: Our ARB predictions anticipate a high of $0.82 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $1.01 and $1.22, with an average price of $1.04. In 2030, it will range between $2.98 and $3.51, with an average price of $3.08. Layer 2s have made quite a buzz over the last few months because of their high network activity. Arbitrum led the Layer 2 pack with a total value locked ( TVL ) of $2.53 billion. Arbitrum is an Optimistic Rollup solution that shifts network operations away from the Ethereum mainnet while maintaining Ethereum-level security. Arbitrum’s BOLD testnet also went live; when integrated into the mainnet, the update will enable permissionless validation on Arbitrum. This means that anyone can challenge the state of the Arbitrum network. Currently, validators are allow-listed. Is Arbitrum a good investment? Will it go up? Where will it be in 5 years? Let’s answer these questions and more in our Arbitrum price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Arbitrum Ticker ARB Current price $0.4326 Market cap $2.33B Trading volume $207.99 Circulating supply 5.4B All-time high $2.40 on Jan 12, 2024 All-time low $0.245 on Apr 7, 2025 24-hour high $0.4563 24-hour low $0.4274 Arbitrum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 8.68% 50-day SMA $0.4877 200-day SMA $0.4111 Sentiment Bearish Green days 14/30 (47%) Fear and Greed Index 71 (Greed) Arbitrum price analysis On October 4, Arbitrum’s price rose by 3.14% over 24 hours to $0.4326, while its trading volume decreased by 32.38% during the same period. Looking back, ARB had a steep decline in April, which saw it register its lowest price since launch at $0.245. It has since recovered the losses. ARB 1-day chart analysis ARBUSD chart by TradingView ARB has support at $0.4085 and trades below major SMA and EMA levels, signaling a bearish market. The MACD histogram (0.0009) confirms little momentum, while the RSI (42.57) is in neutral territory. It is oversold when the value drops below 30. The drop comes after ARB broke below $0.4870 last month. Arbitrum price 4-hour chart price analysis ARBUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that ARB registers negative momentum and that its volatility is dropping. The charts’ short candles are indicative of a bear market. The MACD histograms show its negative momentum rose over the last 16 hours.

ARB’s dip reflects natural profit-taking after a strong quarter and shifting focus toward competing L2 developments. While the network’s fundamentals (DeFi dominance, Robinhood’s RWA integrations) remain intact, traders are cautiously awaiting clearer signals. Why is ARB down? ARB’s decline reflects a mix of technical breakdowns while ecosystem developments like VanEck’s ETF provide long-term upside; near-term risks dominate. Recent news SWIFT announced its blockchain will use Linea (Ethereum L2), challenging Arbitrum’s dominance in institutional adoption. Linea’s TVL ($2.27B) now ranks fourth among L2s. Does Arbitrum have a future? A high adoption rate is crucial for any blockchain’s long-term success and sustainability. Arbitrum’s performance in this regard is a positive sign of its future performance despite the price declines. Is Arbitrum good to buy? Arbitrum is trading at its lowest range this year, with the charts showing it is just above the oversold region. At current prices, ARB is undervalued and is likely to recover if market sentiment changes. On the other hand, the Arbitrum ecosystem’s total value locked has crossed above $2.5 billion, indicating solid utility in decentralized finance. Is Arbitrum a good investment? SkyEcosystem’s Risk Analysis has launched USDS stablecoin on Arbitrum, expanding Arbitrum’s utility, which will attract liquidity to the network. This integration could increase ARB usage, potentially boosting its price. Will Arbitrum reach $10? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ARB is unlikely to reach $10 before 2031. Can Arbitrum reach 100 dollars? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $100 in the period ending in 2031. Will Arbitrum reach $1,000? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $1,000 in the period ending in 2031. Does Arbitrum have a good long-term future? A high adoption rate is crucial for any blockchain’s long-term success and sustainability. Arbitrum’s performance in this regard is a positive sign of its future performance despite the price declines.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/are-these-the-2-best-cryptos-to-buy-as-trump-backed-thumzup-media-expands-dogecoin-mining-with-2-5m-investment/",
        "body": "Thumzup Media, a Trump-backed company, has announced that it has invested $2.5 million in ramping up Dogecoin mining activities with hundreds of additional ASIC rigs and a significant boost in network hash power. The move has rekindled bullish interest in Dogecoin (DOGE), with some speculating that institutional entry may take its price beyond the $1 mark during the next bull run. That said, though DOGE’s momentum is worth keeping an eye on, more seasoned investors are now turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with much greater upside potential. Now at only $0.035, Mutuum Finance has already emerged as one of 2025’s most formidable DeFi plays thanks to its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield tokenomics, and non-custodial smart contract architecture. Presale Stage 6 is already over 55% sold, with more than 16,750 holders and more than $16.8 million raised, all of which are positive indicators of institutional and whale confidence. Mutuum Finance is the smart, utility-backed choice over meme-driven cryptocurrencies like DOGE. Thumzup Media’s $2.5M Investment Has the Potential to Be a Game-Changer for Dogecoin’s Future Dogecoin (DOGE) is winning back institutional confidence after Thumzup Media, a Trump family-supported business, made a substantial $2.5 million investment. The funding will enable DogeHash Technologies to expand its mining capacity exponentially, with over 4,000 mining rigs operational prior to year-end, one of the most extensive Dogecoin mining networks in the U.S. The addition of 500 new high-performance ASIC miners will expand the hash rate of the network, accelerating transaction speed, boosting security, and building further trust in the system as a whole. Thumzup’s entry, signaled by its recent acquisition of 19 BTC and 7.5 million DOGE and eventual investment of as much as $250 million in digital assets, is an indicator of growing institutional interest and confidence in Dogecoin’s long-term potential. Analysts predict the development to catalyze broader institutional uptake and boost DOGE’s position in mainstream crypto portfolios. But as Dogecoin fundamentals keep growing stronger, increasingly more investors are also investigating Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which could offer even greater upside potential beyond the meme-coin narrative. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Traction Mutuum Finance is generating even more hype and anticipation for its presale, with the platform already raising over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 investors onboard to date. Stage 6 of the project is ongoing, during which MUTM tokens are available for purchase at $0.035 per token. In appreciation of early adopters, Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway promotion, in which 10 users will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. The protocol will have a dynamic floating interest rate mechanism that makes the most efficient use of liquidity. Low interest rate environments and excess liquidity environments encourage borrowing and ecosystem activity and high demand environments and higher interest rates encourage loan repayment and incoming capital flows. Fixed interest models function optimally when liquidity is constant, adjusting organically to overall market forces. Mutuum Finance Advances Development of Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance is going ahead with the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , a key step to enhancing its decentralized finance ecosystem. The first version (V1) of the protocol is expected on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will include functionalities such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. ETH and USDT will be supported for lending, borrowing, and collateral at the time of launch, providing users with a convenient and secure DeFi experience. Lending, borrowing, and liquidation at a profit require efficient asset valuation. To this effect, Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to retrieve live USD and principal crypto asset prices such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform realizes optimum data accuracy by utilizing fallback oracle systems, composite data feeds, and time-weighted averages from decentralized exchanges for quality valuations during the highly volatile and distressed market conditions. Dogecoin (DOGE) or Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Dogecoin’s $2.5M mining incentive shows growing interest, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a far more promising prospect. At $0.035 and with over 55% sold, 16,750+ buyers and $16.8M invested, MUTM’s twin lending ecosystem, real-yield tokenomics, and upcoming DeFi protocol render it a utility-based altcoin with tremendous growth potential, which makes DOGE seem like a less desirable option for serious investors.

        "body": "A single podcast moment has sent ripples through both the political and crypto worlds. During a recent appearance on the PBD Podcast, Eric Trump made striking comments about his familiarity with Ripple, XRP, and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. The clip, shared by popular crypto influencer JackTheRippler on X, quickly gained momentum — fueling widespread discussion about the growing intersection between politics and digital finance. The conversation took place during the October 4, 2025, episode of the PBD Podcast, hosted by entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David. When asked how he felt about Dogecoin, XRP, Ripple, and Ethereum, Eric Trump’s candid response caught the attention of the crypto community. “I know them all extremely well. I know Brad very well, and XRP, he’s done a great job,” Trump said. JackTheRippler’s post featuring the clip has since gone viral, with thousands of reposts and comments from the XRP community. Many enthusiasts see Trump’s acknowledgment of Garlinghouse as a symbolic nod to Ripple’s growing relevance in global finance — especially as the company continues to recover from years of legal scrutiny and reposition itself for mainstream adoption. Eric Trump says that he knows Brad Garlinghouse and #XRP very well! pic.twitter.com/EK4bygBRLh — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 4, 2025 A Notable Moment for Ripple and XRP Ripple’s reputation has strengthened considerably in 2025 following the conclusion of its legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple has focused on scaling its payment infrastructure and expanding the reach of RLUSD. In this context, Eric Trump’s praise for Brad Garlinghouse carries additional weight. His words come at a time when institutional interest in blockchain payment systems is accelerating — and when the U.S. political landscape is increasingly open to discussing crypto innovation within regulated frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bridging Politics and Crypto Innovation Eric Trump’s remarks also highlight a broader trend: the mainstreaming of cryptocurrency within political and economic circles. His characterization of Bitcoin as “digital gold” and Ethereum as “financial oil” reflects an informed understanding of their roles within the digital economy. Yet, it was his personal acknowledgment of Brad Garlinghouse and XRP that truly resonated with investors, given Ripple’s established presence in institutional payment settlements. The moment signifies how figures within political leadership are beginning to publicly recognize the companies driving blockchain utility, not just speculative assets. In conclusion, while Eric Trump did not make any investment claims about XRP, his recognition of Brad Garlinghouse and Ripple stands as a noteworthy endorsement from a prominent political figure. The viral clip shared by JackTheRippler underscores how quickly influence, politics, and crypto narratives can converge — sometimes in just a few seconds of conversation. For Ripple and its supporters, those few words from the president’s son may have done more than spark social-media buzz; they reaffirmed that XRP’s name is now part of the mainstream financial dialogue.

        "body": "If you have $1,500 set aside for a high-potential crypto play, there is a fresh name that is catching the eye of early investors. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) built on Ethereum is not just another meme coin. It has already climbed more than 120% from its starting presale price and is currently offering about 36.36% projected gains before its public launch. At the time of writing, LILPEPE is priced at $0.0022 in Stage 13 of its presale, having raised an impressive $26.37 million out of a $28.77 million target. A meme coin with momentum Little Pepe is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about Ethereum meme coins of 2025. The token’s presale has been moving at an incredible pace, with more than 16.15 billion of its 17.25 billion tokens already sold. The presale price recently increased from $0.0021 to $0.0022, reflecting steady demand. This is no small feat considering that Stage 1 investors are already sitting on 120% gains while the presale still has six stages left. The project’s momentum is further boosted by its recent listing on CoinMarketCap and a Certik audit score of 95.49%, which strengthens investor confidence. Being both audited and trackable on a significant platform gives LILPEPE credibility that most meme coins lack. Why investors are watching LILPEPE closely The appeal of Little Pepe goes beyond just hype. It is positioning itself as a Layer 2 meme ecosystem that offers zero trading tax, anti-sniper bot protection, and plans for a meme launchpad and NFT marketplace. These features suggest that it aims to be more than a fleeting trend. Community engagement has been high, with the Team running a $777,000 giveaway and introducing a Mega Giveaway worth over 15 ETH in prizes for top presale buyers from Stage 12 to Stage 17. At a time when crypto markets are searching for the next breakout star after Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, LILPEPE’s strong presale and active rewards are pulling in attention from across the meme coin crowd. How LILPEPE stacks up against the big names As of the time of writing, DOGE trades around $0.12 while SHIB hovers near $0.000018. These meme coins still have strong communities but lack the fresh momentum that drives rapid price surges. Little Pepe has stepped into that gap with a lower entry price and a roadmap that blends meme culture with practical tools. The fact that LILPEPE peaked above PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB in ChatGPT’s memecoin search trends between June and August 2025 hints at rising retail interest. The potential upside For investors entering at Stage 13’s $0.0022 price, the token is expected to launch at $0.0030, offering a near-term 36.36% gain even before its first day of open trading. Early-stage buyers have already seen 120% gains, and the speculative talk of a 75x rally reflects hopes that it can catch a fraction of the market cap of DOGE or SHIB as it gains mainstream attention. Final thoughts If you are looking for a fresh entry into the meme coin market and have $1,500 to spare, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is worth a closer look. It combines meme culture with credible tech and is already rewarding early participants. With the presale selling out fast at the time of writing and still offering projected gains of 36.36% before launch, this could be a rare chance to enter early. The presale is nearing its final stages, and as history has shown with other meme sensations, the early days often present the biggest growth window.

        "url": "https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/dogecoin-doge-solana-sol-little-pepe-lilpepe-one-of-these-top-cryptos-to-buy-in-2025-holds-45x-potential/",
        "body": "The 2025 market is shaping up to be one of the most competitive in crypto history. Big names like Dogecoin and Solana are still drawing capital, but a newcomer, Little Pepe, is quietly stacking numbers that hint at far greater upside. Here’s how each project positions itself and why one could realistically deliver 45x gains. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Energy With Real Tech Underneath Little Pepe (LILPEPE) isn’t just another token riding Ethereum’s coattails. It’s building its own Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 network that handles transactions cheaply and at scale. Think of it as a meme coin with the backbone of a serious blockchain. The presale tells the story. With a hard cap of 100 billion tokens, 26.5 billion are set aside for early buyers. Stage 13 is live at $0.0022; more than 16.15 billion tokens have already been sold, pulling in $26.36 million. Stage 14 will tick up to $0.0023, a 120% jump from the starting price of $0.001. Early participants have already locked in triple-digit paper gains before a single exchange listing. Every presale round has increased the price. Stage 1 raised $500K at $0.001, Stage 2 climbed to $0.0011 for $1.325 million, Stage 3 reached $0.0012 for $2.5 million, creating a built-in momentum machine that rewards early conviction. Why Investors Are Taking Notice Little Pepe isn’t just relying on hype. Its feature set is designed to solve real issues in the meme coin space. There’s zero trading tax, so holders keep every bit of their gains. Sniper-bot protection ensures a fairer launch and less manipulation, and staking functionality enables long-term investors to earn passive income. Yet the most interesting element is the Meme Launchpad, an incubator that natively enables emerging meme projects to launch within the Little Pepe ecosystem. With DAO-based governance, NFT integration, and cross-chain compatibility on the roadmap in the future, the project is building foundations that could extend far beyond its current Layer 2 focus. To keep the community buzzing, the team has stacked giveaways. The headline is a $777,000 presale prize pool , with ten winners taking home $77,000 each, and a minimum buy-in of just $100. A separate Mega Giveaway across Stages 12–17 adds over 15 ETH in rewards, split between top buyers and random participants. Few meme projects have aggressively combined hype, utility, and incentive structures. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Original Meme Giant Faces New Challenges Dogecoin still holds cultural sway, but its momentum has certainly slowed. DOGE has not returned to the heights of around $0.74, and subsequent corrections in 2025 have tempered investors’ expectations. All that could change with the recently launched Rex-Osprey Dogecoin ETF, which could introduce institutional money into the picture and potentially drive DOGE to $0.40 or even $1. Still, the days of 100x returns are likely behind it. As the meme coin landscape shifts toward projects with stronger utility and more robust ecosystems, Dogecoin’s once-unassailable throne looks more vulnerable than ever. Solana (SOL): The Backbone of DeFi’s Next Wave Solana remains one of the most essential blockchains in the Web3 space and for good reason. It can process thousands of transactions per second at minimal cost and become the go-to network for lending platforms, NFT marketplaces, and DeFi protocols. If adoption keeps climbing at the current pace, analysts predict a price range of $500–$750 by 2030, particularly as institutional capital continues to pour in. Solana’s Firedancer will continue to enhance stability, solidifying Solana as a foundational layer for the next generation of dApps. Bottom Line Dogecoin and Solana offer proven ecosystems and the comfort of established networks, but their upside is capped. Little Pepe , still priced at just $0.0022, sits where past giants once stood, early, hungry, and built to scale. If its Layer-2 tech, launchpad, and aggressive presale strategy keep gaining traction, a 45x move isn’t a fantasy. The window to grab LILPEPE under a quarter of a cent is barely open for investors chasing the next breakout before the market wakes up.

Global leaders warn as tech giants drive valuations beyond fundamentals 🇺🇸🇺🇸 Over 50% of the US market cap is now pure Tech. Defensives have collapsed to under 15%. This isn’t diversification – it’s a Tech Empire 🇺🇸🇺🇸 $tsla $nvda $google $appl #Bitcoin $qqq pic.twitter.com/taa4SxxSME — Hod | Code2Capital (@HodTzdaka) October 3, 2025 David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, warned on Friday at Italian Tech Week in Turin, that an AI investment frenzy may be overdone and that stock markets are due for a “drawdown.” Solomon said major US stock indexes have notched record high after record high this year on the promise of artificial intelligence. He argued that there’s a good chance that not all of those investments will deliver big returns. He noted that the internet craze of the late 1990s and early 2000s drew a frenzy of investment in tech companies at the time. Solomon reminded the crowd that the internet craze was followed by a dramatic collapse, which is commonly known as the “dot-com bubble”. “I wouldn’t be surprised if in the next 12 to 24 months, we see a drawdown with respect to equity markets.” David Solomon , Goldman Sachs CEO Jeff Bezos referred to the AI investment wave as an “industrial bubble.” He also emphasized that innovation stemming from such AI investment cycles can still yield long-term advantages. According to Bezos, the market is seeking the next big breakthrough, reminiscent of the dynamics of previous bubbles. He added that the previous bubble dynamic is why many small AI ventures with weak foundations receive investment. On October 3, Dario Perkins, TS Lombard’s Managing Director of Global Macro Research, raised an alarm when he noticed that big tech companies were increasingly using off-balance-sheet loans and special purpose entities (SPVs) to finance AI equipment. According to Perkins, this is a “recognition that this is getting out of hand.” Perkins emphasized that the real leverage and risk exposure of businesses like Meta, which has requested $29 billion in private finance for the expansion of its AI data centre, are concealed by such borrowing techniques.

        "body": "Markets have a way of testing conviction before rewarding it. For XRP holders, that moment of quiet before the storm feels closer than ever. After months of sideways consolidation and growing impatience, many analysts now believe XRP is positioning itself for a powerful move — one that could redefine its market trajectory when it finally unfolds. The Setup: Pattern and Price Renowned market observer The Crypto Philosopher recently shared a striking technical comparison between XRP’s current structure and Amazon’s chart from the early 2000s. In the video, XRP’s weekly chart is overlaid with Amazon’s long-term base that preceded its historic 14x rally from $5 to $70. The resemblance, he argues, is no coincidence. A cup-and-handle pattern is emerging in XRP’s chart, a classic bullish setup that typically precedes a significant upward move. According to The Crypto Philosopher, XRP’s current support sits firmly around $2.70, with a critical breakout level near $3.02. A confirmed move above this resistance, especially with increasing trading volume, could ignite a parabolic run — mirroring the way Amazon’s breakout unleashed years of compounding gains. Xrp is on the brink of its parabolic run It’ll happen when you least expect it Just keep waiting pic.twitter.com/laTpiG5nzE — The Crypto Philosopher (@TheCryptoP73649) October 2, 2025 The Amazon Analogy and Its Implications The comparison to Amazon is notable because it suggests XRP is following a similar pattern of accumulation before explosive growth. Just as Amazon built a foundation for years after the dot-com crash, XRP has been laying groundwork despite market doubts and regulatory challenges. While parallels between equities and digital assets should be drawn with caution, the core logic remains: strong fundamentals, persistent development, and an extended consolidation phase can set the stage for substantial upward revaluation. In XRP’s case, the alignment of technical structure, liquidity positioning, and renewed investor sentiment strengthens the bullish argument. The Expected Timeline If the pattern continues to unfold as projected, XRP could be entering the final stretch of its handle formation, a period that typically lasts from several days to a few weeks before a breakout confirmation. Analysts suggest that a decisive close above $3.02 would mark the official start of the next leg up. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From there, momentum could accelerate rapidly, driven by institutional inflows, renewed market confidence, and increased adoption of Ripple’s technologies in real-world payments and tokenization. However, timing remains fluid. True parabolic runs rarely announce themselves in advance. As The Crypto Philosopher aptly noted, “It’ll happen when you least expect it.” Risks and Confirmation Signals Despite the bullish outlook, traders are urged to remain disciplined. False breakouts can occur, especially in a volatile market. To confirm the trend, analysts suggest looking for three key indicators: sustained volume growth, successful retests of new support levels, and overall crypto market strength driven by Bitcoin. In summary, XRP’s technical setup is nearing a crucial inflection point. If price and volume converge as anticipated, the conditions for a parabolic surge could soon align — turning patience into payoff for long-term believers. Yet, as every seasoned trader knows, conviction must be matched with caution, because even the most promising charts demand validation before the real run begins.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/",
        "body": "Key Takeaways: Our Ordinals price prediction anticipates a high of $29.81 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $8 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $8.32 Market cap $174.77M 24-hour trading volume $38.73M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2024 24-hour high $8.95 24-hour low $8.18 Ordi price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 8.87% 50-day SMA $9.05 200-day SMA $9.34 Sentiment Bearish Green days 16/30 (53%) Fear and Greed Index 71 (Greed) Ordi price analysis On the day of writing (October 4), ORDI’s price dropped by 5.51% in 24 hours and 0.11% in the last seven days. Its trading volume dropped by 17.16% showing less trader conviction in the market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades along the Williams alligator trendlines, signaling an uneventful market as the price bounced off support levels ($7.70 Fibonacci midpoint) and key moving averages. The coin has registered negative momentum in the last 7 days. The MACD and signal lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, signaling a bear market. At the same time, the relative strength index is in neutral territory at 44.51. It is oversold when the RSI falls below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI is moving sideways at the $8.39 mark with MACD confirmation (-0.029). The William Alligator trendlines show falling volatility. ORDI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 8.69 SELL SMA 5 8.40 SELL SMA 10 8.46 SELL SMA 21 9.09 SELL SMA 50 9.05 SELL SMA 100 9.17 SELL SMA 200 9.34 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 8.78 SELL EMA 5 8.85 SELL EMA 10 8.91 SELL EMA 21 9.05 SELL EMA 50 9.17 SELL EMA 100 9.38 SELL EMA 200 11.87 SELL What to expect from ORDI price analysis next? ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. Over the short term, ORDI remains correlated with Bitcoin, which is just below $122,000. The charts show it will continue downwards but with less volatility. Why is ORDI down? ORDI’s drop reflects technical triggers, Bitcoin-driven risk aversion, and technical overextension. Its status as a “Bitcoin beta” leaves it exposed during dominance rallies, while thin liquidity magnifies moves. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10. In October, it traded above the $8 mark.",

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-high-can-ethereum-eth-go-this-uptober-chatgpt-breaks-it-down-and-names-a-cheaper-must-buy-crypto-for-2025/",
        "body": "The Uptober month is already living up to its name, with Ethereum (ETH) returning to the limelight as specialists foresee a possible breakout higher than $5,000, and as high as $5,500. More institutional inflows, optimism regarding the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, and higher Layer-2 adoption are all helping to create bullish momentum for the world’s second-largest altcoin. But while ETH’s potential upside remains strong, investors are becoming more interested in a much more high-upside play, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with far greater growth potential at a fraction of the expense. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance has been one of the most popular DeFi projects in 2025 with its twin lending infrastructure, real-yield mechanics, and non-custodial smart contracts tackling critical inefficiencies of decentralized finance. With Stage 6 of its presale over 55% sold out, 16,750+ holders, and over $16.8 million raised, MUTM could outshine ETH in the next run. Ethereum (ETH) Positions Itself for a Strong Uptober Rally Ethereum (ETH) is positioning itself for a potential explosive rally in October 2025, with prices keeping their strength around $4,300 after a steep bounce above $4,000. October, which is known as “Uptober” among traders, historically comes with average returns of nearly 5%, and this time the setup looks even stronger. Institutional demand is increasing as ETH investment funds attract hundreds of millions of inflows, with big players such as BlackRock ongoing in developing its network. At the same time, 30% of the ETH supply is now staked, locking up coins and removing circulating supply from the network, as deflationary token burns further tighten market dynamics. With exhausted exchange reserves, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the bullish BTC trend, and greater crypto euphoria around key U.S. events, analysts say that a breakout above $5,000 is eminently within the realm of possibility. But although ETH displays dazzling upside, the vast majority of investors seeking greater growth potential are starting to eye Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for out-of-proportion returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge as Investor Frenzy Hits All-Time High Mutuum Finance has been providing early adopters with the special opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a lower cost before the project is officially launched. Phase 6 tokens available at $0.035 have been extremely sought after, presale already reaching over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 owners. The figures say volumes of active market enthusiasm and increasing faith in the future of the long-term business. Besides locking down the platform and engaging with community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program with an official $50,000 USDT bug bounty pool. The program invites white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to report codebase vulnerabilities with rewards paid out depending on severity. This ensures that even the minor problems are addressed as quickly as possible and general platform security is high. Mutuum Finance to Roll Out New DeFi Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has announced the upcoming release of its own lending and borrowing protocol , a giant leap towards decentralized finance. The V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have the fundamental components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Since ETH and USDT are supported from the start for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing, the platform aims to offer a stable and scalable foundation for users of DeFi. To access recent and real-time prices, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles along with high-cap token feeds like USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references are provided, which allow multi-layered functionality to supply robust and secure price data in the face of ultra-abnormal market chaos. Ethereum’s “Uptober” rally may propel ETH to over $5,000, yet its potential is capped compared to the early-stage possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at only $0.035 is already more than 55% sold in phase 6 with $16.8M raised, presents much greater growth potential. Its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield structure, and robust presale traction make MUTM the top DeFi altcoin for investors seeking disproportionate 2025 returns.

Bitcoin’s increasing institutional adoption and improving regulatory clarity create a favorable environment for mining operations. Additionally, the upcoming halving cycles historically correlate with significant price appreciation, potentially amplifying mining returns.

This approach ensures sustainable and profitable operations that individual miners simply cannot match. The crypto market’s maturation also means more sophisticated investors are looking for reliable passive income streams. Mining provides this opportunity without the volatility of trading or the complexity of DeFi protocols.

Global leaders warn as tech giants drive valuations beyond fundamentals 🇺🇸🇺🇸 Over 50% of the US market cap is now pure Tech. Defensives have collapsed to under 15%. This isn’t diversification – it’s a Tech Empire 🇺🇸🇺🇸 $tsla $nvda $google $appl #Bitcoin $qqq pic.twitter.com/taa4SxxSME — Hod | Code2Capital (@HodTzdaka) October 3, 2025 David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, warned on Friday at Italian Tech Week in Turin, that an AI investment frenzy may be overdone and that stock markets are due for a “drawdown.” Solomon said major US stock indexes have notched record high after record high this year on the promise of artificial intelligence. He argued that there’s a good chance that not all of those investments will deliver big returns. He noted that the internet craze of the late 1990s and early 2000s drew a frenzy of investment in tech companies at the time. Solomon reminded the crowd that the internet craze was followed by a dramatic collapse, which is commonly known as the “dot-com bubble”. “I wouldn’t be surprised if in the next 12 to 24 months, we see a drawdown with respect to equity markets.” David Solomon , Goldman Sachs CEO Jeff Bezos referred to the AI investment wave as an “industrial bubble.” He also emphasized that innovation stemming from such AI investment cycles can still yield long-term advantages. According to Bezos, the market is seeking the next big breakthrough, reminiscent of the dynamics of previous bubbles. He added that the previous bubble dynamic is why many small AI ventures with weak foundations receive investment. On October 3, Dario Perkins, TS Lombard’s Managing Director of Global Macro Research, raised an alarm when he noticed that big tech companies were increasingly using off-balance-sheet loans and special purpose entities (SPVs) to finance AI equipment. According to Perkins, this is a “recognition that this is getting out of hand.” Perkins emphasized that the real leverage and risk exposure of businesses like Meta, which has requested $29 billion in private finance for the expansion of its AI data centre, are concealed by such borrowing techniques.

Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $8 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030?

The charts show it will continue downwards but with less volatility. Why is ORDI down? ORDI’s drop reflects technical triggers, Bitcoin-driven risk aversion, and technical overextension. Its status as a “Bitcoin beta” leaves it exposed during dominance rallies, while thin liquidity magnifies moves. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.

According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000?

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10. In October, it traded above the $8 mark.",

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-high-can-ethereum-eth-go-this-uptober-chatgpt-breaks-it-down-and-names-a-cheaper-must-buy-crypto-for-2025/",
        "body": "The Uptober month is already living up to its name, with Ethereum (ETH) returning to the limelight as specialists foresee a possible breakout higher than $5,000, and as high as $5,500. More institutional inflows, optimism regarding the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, and higher Layer-2 adoption are all helping to create bullish momentum for the world’s second-largest altcoin. But while ETH’s potential upside remains strong, investors are becoming more interested in a much more high-upside play, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with far greater growth potential at a fraction of the expense. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance has been one of the most popular DeFi projects in 2025 with its twin lending infrastructure, real-yield mechanics, and non-custodial smart contracts tackling critical inefficiencies of decentralized finance. With Stage 6 of its presale over 55% sold out, 16,750+ holders, and over $16.8 million raised, MUTM could outshine ETH in the next run. Ethereum (ETH) Positions Itself for a Strong Uptober Rally Ethereum (ETH) is positioning itself for a potential explosive rally in October 2025, with prices keeping their strength around $4,300 after a steep bounce above $4,000. October, which is known as “Uptober” among traders, historically comes with average returns of nearly 5%, and this time the setup looks even stronger. Institutional demand is increasing as ETH investment funds attract hundreds of millions of inflows, with big players such as BlackRock ongoing in developing its network. At the same time, 30% of the ETH supply is now staked, locking up coins and removing circulating supply from the network, as deflationary token burns further tighten market dynamics. With exhausted exchange reserves, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the bullish BTC trend, and greater crypto euphoria around key U.S. events, analysts say that a breakout above $5,000 is eminently within the realm of possibility. But although ETH displays dazzling upside, the vast majority of investors seeking greater growth potential are starting to eye Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for out-of-proportion returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge as Investor Frenzy Hits All-Time High Mutuum Finance has been providing early adopters with the special opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a lower cost before the project is officially launched. Phase 6 tokens available at $0.035 have been extremely sought after, presale already reaching over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 owners. The figures say volumes of active market enthusiasm and increasing faith in the future of the long-term business. Besides locking down the platform and engaging with community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program with an official $50,000 USDT bug bounty pool. The program invites white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to report codebase vulnerabilities with rewards paid out depending on severity. This ensures that even the minor problems are addressed as quickly as possible and general platform security is high. Mutuum Finance to Roll Out New DeFi Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has announced the upcoming release of its own lending and borrowing protocol , a giant leap towards decentralized finance. The V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have the fundamental components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Since ETH and USDT are supported from the start for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing, the platform aims to offer a stable and scalable foundation for users of DeFi. To access recent and real-time prices, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles along with high-cap token feeds like USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references are provided, which allow multi-layered functionality to supply robust and secure price data in the face of ultra-abnormal market chaos. Ethereum’s “Uptober” rally may propel ETH to over $5,000, yet its potential is capped compared to the early-stage possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at only $0.035 is already more than 55% sold in phase 6 with $16.8M raised, presents much greater growth potential. Its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield structure, and robust presale traction make MUTM the top DeFi altcoin for investors seeking disproportionate 2025 returns.

        "body": "Ethereum’s steward moved part of its crypto coffers this week, converting a chunk of ETH into stablecoins as it adjusts how it funds projects and grants. Foundation Moves To Stablecoin Holdings According to reports, the Ethereum Foundation converted 1,000 ETH into stablecoins using the decentralized trading router CoW Swap, a transaction worth about $4.5 million at the time. The move was executed as part of the foundation’s ongoing treasury actions and was presented as a step to secure more predictable funds for research, grants, and donations. The specific stablecoin or coins received in exchange were not publicly named in initial reports. The Foundation’s treasurer has been managing a broader plan. Reports have disclosed a previously stated intention to convert up to 10,000 Ether over a period of weeks, and this latest trade appears to be an element of that phased approach rather than a one-off sale. Holding stable assets gives the foundation a clearer view of its short-term spending power while it evaluates longer-term strategy. 1/ Today, The Ethereum Foundation will convert 1000 ETH to stablecoins via @CoWSwap ‘s TWAP feature, as part of our ongoing work to fund R&D, grants and donations, and to highlight the power of DeFi. — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) October 3, 2025 Use Of Decentralized Trading Tools The choice to use CoW Swap — a decentralized aggregator that aims to reduce slippage and market impact — was highlighted in public coverage. By routing the trade through decentralized infrastructure instead of a single centralized exchange, the Foundation reduced some counterparty and custody concerns. The execution method was described as careful and aimed at protecting the value of the sale during the swap. Alongside the transaction, internal operational decisions have also been articulated. The Foundation indicated it temporarily applied the breaks on open submissions of a grant for its Ecosystem Support Program in order to give attention to the large influx of proposals and prioritize urgent or high-impact work. Changes in leadership and institutional reorganization, have also been discussed publicly as part of recent organizational action, portrayed in a manner that suggests a transition is underway internally to accompany any change in the direction of treasury management as well. What Comes Next For The Treasury Market watchers noted that converting ETH to stablecoins is a common liquidity-management tactic. Volatility in ETH’s price can make budgeting for multi-month support programs difficult; stable assets can smooth out planning. While some community members saw the sale as a reduction of ETH holdings, others pointed out that the foundation’s core mission — to support Ethereum’s development — remains unchanged.

Global leaders warn as tech giants drive valuations beyond fundamentals 🇺🇸🇺🇸 Over 50% of the US market cap is now pure Tech. Defensives have collapsed to under 15%. This isn’t diversification – it’s a Tech Empire 🇺🇸🇺🇸 $tsla $nvda $google $appl #Bitcoin $qqq pic.twitter.com/taa4SxxSME — Hod | Code2Capital (@HodTzdaka) October 3, 2025 David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, warned on Friday at Italian Tech Week in Turin, that an AI investment frenzy may be overdone and that stock markets are due for a “drawdown.” Solomon said major US stock indexes have notched record high after record high this year on the promise of artificial intelligence. He argued that there’s a good chance that not all of those investments will deliver big returns. He noted that the internet craze of the late 1990s and early 2000s drew a frenzy of investment in tech companies at the time. Solomon reminded the crowd that the internet craze was followed by a dramatic collapse, which is commonly known as the “dot-com bubble”. “I wouldn’t be surprised if in the next 12 to 24 months, we see a drawdown with respect to equity markets.” David Solomon , Goldman Sachs CEO Jeff Bezos referred to the AI investment wave as an “industrial bubble.” He also emphasized that innovation stemming from such AI investment cycles can still yield long-term advantages. According to Bezos, the market is seeking the next big breakthrough, reminiscent of the dynamics of previous bubbles. He added that the previous bubble dynamic is why many small AI ventures with weak foundations receive investment. On October 3, Dario Perkins, TS Lombard’s Managing Director of Global Macro Research, raised an alarm when he noticed that big tech companies were increasingly using off-balance-sheet loans and special purpose entities (SPVs) to finance AI equipment. According to Perkins, this is a “recognition that this is getting out of hand.” Perkins emphasized that the real leverage and risk exposure of businesses like Meta, which has requested $29 billion in private finance for the expansion of its AI data centre, are concealed by such borrowing techniques.

        "body": "The Uptober month is already living up to its name, with Ethereum (ETH) returning to the limelight as specialists foresee a possible breakout higher than $5,000, and as high as $5,500. More institutional inflows, optimism regarding the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, and higher Layer-2 adoption are all helping to create bullish momentum for the world’s second-largest altcoin. But while ETH’s potential upside remains strong, investors are becoming more interested in a much more high-upside play, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with far greater growth potential at a fraction of the expense. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance has been one of the most popular DeFi projects in 2025 with its twin lending infrastructure, real-yield mechanics, and non-custodial smart contracts tackling critical inefficiencies of decentralized finance. With Stage 6 of its presale over 55% sold out, 16,750+ holders, and over $16.8 million raised, MUTM could outshine ETH in the next run. Ethereum (ETH) Positions Itself for a Strong Uptober Rally Ethereum (ETH) is positioning itself for a potential explosive rally in October 2025, with prices keeping their strength around $4,300 after a steep bounce above $4,000. October, which is known as “Uptober” among traders, historically comes with average returns of nearly 5%, and this time the setup looks even stronger. Institutional demand is increasing as ETH investment funds attract hundreds of millions of inflows, with big players such as BlackRock ongoing in developing its network. At the same time, 30% of the ETH supply is now staked, locking up coins and removing circulating supply from the network, as deflationary token burns further tighten market dynamics. With exhausted exchange reserves, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the bullish BTC trend, and greater crypto euphoria around key U.S. events, analysts say that a breakout above $5,000 is eminently within the realm of possibility. But although ETH displays dazzling upside, the vast majority of investors seeking greater growth potential are starting to eye Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for out-of-proportion returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge as Investor Frenzy Hits All-Time High Mutuum Finance has been providing early adopters with the special opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a lower cost before the project is officially launched. Phase 6 tokens available at $0.035 have been extremely sought after, presale already reaching over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 owners. The figures say volumes of active market enthusiasm and increasing faith in the future of the long-term business. Besides locking down the platform and engaging with community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program with an official $50,000 USDT bug bounty pool. The program invites white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to report codebase vulnerabilities with rewards paid out depending on severity. This ensures that even the minor problems are addressed as quickly as possible and general platform security is high. Mutuum Finance to Roll Out New DeFi Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has announced the upcoming release of its own lending and borrowing protocol , a giant leap towards decentralized finance. The V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have the fundamental components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Since ETH and USDT are supported from the start for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing, the platform aims to offer a stable and scalable foundation for users of DeFi. To access recent and real-time prices, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles along with high-cap token feeds like USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references are provided, which allow multi-layered functionality to supply robust and secure price data in the face of ultra-abnormal market chaos. Ethereum’s “Uptober” rally may propel ETH to over $5,000, yet its potential is capped compared to the early-stage possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at only $0.035 is already more than 55% sold in phase 6 with $16.8M raised, presents much greater growth potential. Its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield structure, and robust presale traction make MUTM the top DeFi altcoin for investors seeking disproportionate 2025 returns.

Bitcoin’s increasing institutional adoption and improving regulatory clarity create a favorable environment for mining operations. Additionally, the upcoming halving cycles historically correlate with significant price appreciation, potentially amplifying mining returns.

This approach ensures sustainable and profitable operations that individual miners simply cannot match. The crypto market’s maturation also means more sophisticated investors are looking for reliable passive income streams. Mining provides this opportunity without the volatility of trading or the complexity of DeFi protocols.

        "body": "Ethereum’s steward moved part of its crypto coffers this week, converting a chunk of ETH into stablecoins as it adjusts how it funds projects and grants. Foundation Moves To Stablecoin Holdings According to reports, the Ethereum Foundation converted 1,000 ETH into stablecoins using the decentralized trading router CoW Swap, a transaction worth about $4.5 million at the time. The move was executed as part of the foundation’s ongoing treasury actions and was presented as a step to secure more predictable funds for research, grants, and donations. The specific stablecoin or coins received in exchange were not publicly named in initial reports. The Foundation’s treasurer has been managing a broader plan. Reports have disclosed a previously stated intention to convert up to 10,000 Ether over a period of weeks, and this latest trade appears to be an element of that phased approach rather than a one-off sale. Holding stable assets gives the foundation a clearer view of its short-term spending power while it evaluates longer-term strategy. 1/ Today, The Ethereum Foundation will convert 1000 ETH to stablecoins via @CoWSwap ‘s TWAP feature, as part of our ongoing work to fund R&D, grants and donations, and to highlight the power of DeFi. — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) October 3, 2025 Use Of Decentralized Trading Tools The choice to use CoW Swap — a decentralized aggregator that aims to reduce slippage and market impact — was highlighted in public coverage. By routing the trade through decentralized infrastructure instead of a single centralized exchange, the Foundation reduced some counterparty and custody concerns. The execution method was described as careful and aimed at protecting the value of the sale during the swap. Alongside the transaction, internal operational decisions have also been articulated. The Foundation indicated it temporarily applied the breaks on open submissions of a grant for its Ecosystem Support Program in order to give attention to the large influx of proposals and prioritize urgent or high-impact work. Changes in leadership and institutional reorganization, have also been discussed publicly as part of recent organizational action, portrayed in a manner that suggests a transition is underway internally to accompany any change in the direction of treasury management as well. What Comes Next For The Treasury Market watchers noted that converting ETH to stablecoins is a common liquidity-management tactic. Volatility in ETH’s price can make budgeting for multi-month support programs difficult; stable assets can smooth out planning. While some community members saw the sale as a reduction of ETH holdings, others pointed out that the foundation’s core mission — to support Ethereum’s development — remains unchanged.

Phase 6 tokens available at $0.035 have been extremely sought after, presale already reaching over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 owners. The figures say volumes of active market enthusiasm and increasing faith in the future of the long-term business. Besides locking down the platform and engaging with community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program with an official $50,000 USDT bug bounty pool. The program invites white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to report codebase vulnerabilities with rewards paid out depending on severity. This ensures that even the minor problems are addressed as quickly as possible and general platform security is high. Mutuum Finance to Roll Out New DeFi Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has announced the upcoming release of its own lending and borrowing protocol , a giant leap towards decentralized finance. The V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have the fundamental components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Since ETH and USDT are supported from the start for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing, the platform aims to offer a stable and scalable foundation for users of DeFi. To access recent and real-time prices, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles along with high-cap token feeds like USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references are provided, which allow multi-layered functionality to supply robust and secure price data in the face of ultra-abnormal market chaos. Ethereum’s “Uptober” rally may propel ETH to over $5,000, yet its potential is capped compared to the early-stage possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at only $0.035 is already more than 55% sold in phase 6 with $16.8M raised, presents much greater growth potential. Its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield structure, and robust presale traction make MUTM the top DeFi altcoin for investors seeking disproportionate 2025 returns.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/are-these-the-2-best-cryptos-to-buy-as-trump-backed-thumzup-media-expands-dogecoin-mining-with-2-5m-investment/",
        "body": "Thumzup Media, a Trump-backed company, has announced that it has invested $2.5 million in ramping up Dogecoin mining activities with hundreds of additional ASIC rigs and a significant boost in network hash power. The move has rekindled bullish interest in Dogecoin (DOGE), with some speculating that institutional entry may take its price beyond the $1 mark during the next bull run. That said, though DOGE’s momentum is worth keeping an eye on, more seasoned investors are now turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with much greater upside potential. Now at only $0.035, Mutuum Finance has already emerged as one of 2025’s most formidable DeFi plays thanks to its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield tokenomics, and non-custodial smart contract architecture. Presale Stage 6 is already over 55% sold, with more than 16,750 holders and more than $16.8 million raised, all of which are positive indicators of institutional and whale confidence. Mutuum Finance is the smart, utility-backed choice over meme-driven cryptocurrencies like DOGE. Thumzup Media’s $2.5M Investment Has the Potential to Be a Game-Changer for Dogecoin’s Future Dogecoin (DOGE) is winning back institutional confidence after Thumzup Media, a Trump family-supported business, made a substantial $2.5 million investment. The funding will enable DogeHash Technologies to expand its mining capacity exponentially, with over 4,000 mining rigs operational prior to year-end, one of the most extensive Dogecoin mining networks in the U.S. The addition of 500 new high-performance ASIC miners will expand the hash rate of the network, accelerating transaction speed, boosting security, and building further trust in the system as a whole. Thumzup’s entry, signaled by its recent acquisition of 19 BTC and 7.5 million DOGE and eventual investment of as much as $250 million in digital assets, is an indicator of growing institutional interest and confidence in Dogecoin’s long-term potential. Analysts predict the development to catalyze broader institutional uptake and boost DOGE’s position in mainstream crypto portfolios. But as Dogecoin fundamentals keep growing stronger, increasingly more investors are also investigating Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which could offer even greater upside potential beyond the meme-coin narrative. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Traction Mutuum Finance is generating even more hype and anticipation for its presale, with the platform already raising over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 investors onboard to date. Stage 6 of the project is ongoing, during which MUTM tokens are available for purchase at $0.035 per token. In appreciation of early adopters, Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway promotion, in which 10 users will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. The protocol will have a dynamic floating interest rate mechanism that makes the most efficient use of liquidity. Low interest rate environments and excess liquidity environments encourage borrowing and ecosystem activity and high demand environments and higher interest rates encourage loan repayment and incoming capital flows. Fixed interest models function optimally when liquidity is constant, adjusting organically to overall market forces. Mutuum Finance Advances Development of Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance is going ahead with the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , a key step to enhancing its decentralized finance ecosystem. The first version (V1) of the protocol is expected on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will include functionalities such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. ETH and USDT will be supported for lending, borrowing, and collateral at the time of launch, providing users with a convenient and secure DeFi experience. Lending, borrowing, and liquidation at a profit require efficient asset valuation. To this effect, Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to retrieve live USD and principal crypto asset prices such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform realizes optimum data accuracy by utilizing fallback oracle systems, composite data feeds, and time-weighted averages from decentralized exchanges for quality valuations during the highly volatile and distressed market conditions. Dogecoin (DOGE) or Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Dogecoin’s $2.5M mining incentive shows growing interest, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a far more promising prospect. At $0.035 and with over 55% sold, 16,750+ buyers and $16.8M invested, MUTM’s twin lending ecosystem, real-yield tokenomics, and upcoming DeFi protocol render it a utility-based altcoin with tremendous growth potential, which makes DOGE seem like a less desirable option for serious investors.

        "url": "https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-outlook-analysts-weigh-sol-xrp-and-little-pepe-heres-which-one-will-dominate-in-2025/",
        "body": "SOL is holding firm at $200 as it battles to stay afloat. Several factors suggest it could rebound soon. Besides Solana, two other projects are contending for dominance: Ripple (XRP) and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . Each one of them is gaining significant attention in the crypto space. Their setup suggests that they could dominate in 2025. In this article, we will discuss each and find out which one will win in 2025. Solana (SOL): Institutional Magnet With Expanding On-Chain Utility Solana (SOL) trades near $203, after a pullback from earlier-month highs. However, on-chain activity remains robust. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) stands at around $13–14 billion, with healthy DEX and perpetual (perp) volumes supporting the network’s utility. Institutional flows have continued through the correction. The REX-Osprey Solana ETF experienced notable inflows of $65 million in mid-September, despite prices softening. Also, staking-oriented ETF products are expanding institutional access. Recent SEC rule changes have also lowered the bar for spot crypto ETFs, potentially accelerating product launches tied to SOL. Together, these factors suggest SOL could benefit if institutional allocation and on-chain demand persist. Ripple (XRP): Regulatory Clarity Meets Amidst Institutional Demand XRP trades near $2.80 as ETF optimism rises. It has recently partnered with DBS and Franklin Templeton to enable tokenized money-market fund trading on the XRP Ledger. This highlights institutional use cases beyond pure payments. The SEC’s September rule updates have also made multiple spot-ETF filings more feasible. This increases the odds of XRP-linked products and potential large inflows. Still, analysts caution that ETF approvals alone may not translate into sustained retail rallies unless institutional adoption leads to on-ledger volume and real-world flows. For instance, despite strong volume from the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF, XRP’s price has only fallen further below. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Culture Reinvented With Real Utility Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has positioned itself as a new frontier in meme tokens. It combines community-driven appeal with a solid technical foundation. Its presale, now in Stage 13, has already raised over $26.3 million and sold more than 16 billion tokens at $0.0022. This signals a strong early conviction among investors. Little Pepe is powered by Pepe Chain, an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 built for memes. The chain delivers low gas fees and fast finality. It also offers built-in protections against sniper bots. Its tokenomics are designed to reward sustainability. It includes zero buy/sell tax, staking mechanisms, and a share allocated for ecosystem growth. A key pillar is Pepe’s Pump Pad, the native launchpad that allows meme projects to deploy directly on the chain. Tokens launched via the pump pad help drive transaction volume, feeding demand back into LILPEPE itself. This creates a looping effect of utility and engagement. Credibility has been bolstered through a successful CertiK audit and listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. On the team side, Little Pepe is backed by anonymous experts with experience in meme project growth. This gives it a level of credibility that’s easily backed by its roadmap. Planned listings on two Tier-1 centralized exchanges at launch, along with future plans for the world’s largest exchange, could put LILPEPE in the spotlight as trading begins. Given its lower valuation, strong ecosystem design, and viral potential, Little Pepe may offer higher upside growth curves. SOL vs. XRP vs. LILPEPE: Which One Will Dominate in 2025? Solana offers institutional-grade security and broad infrastructure utilization. This makes it a reliable foundation for numerous blockchain applications. If demand for scalable smart contract platforms continues under regulatory clarity, SOL may capture substantial adoption. XRP’s strength lies in serving as a regulatory and institutional bridge—if legal frameworks favor financial token use cases, XRP could benefit strongly. Yet, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the wildcard. While SOL and XRP dominate with utility and legitimacy, LILPEPE blends memetic culture and core infrastructure, targeting the meme sector itself. In a cycle that may lean heavily on viral growth and novelty, LILPEPE could outperform in percentage gains. Analysts may see SOL capturing market share and XRP anchoring institutional flows. However, for raw upside, Little Pepe stands as the candidate with the most room to scale. Dominance depends on whether 2025 rewards infrastructure, regulation, or memetic innovation. And LILPEPE is best positioned if meme-utility fusion becomes the narrative. Conclusion Solana, Ripple, and Little Pepe each present a distinct path toward dominance in 2025. SOL combines infrastructure strength and adoption. On the other hand, XRP bridges financial legitimacy with crypto access. But it is Little Pepe that merges meme culture with technical depth, offering potentially explosive growth. Though it carries a higher risk, its robust presale performance, ecosystem development, and launchpad mechanics provide it with the framework to compete meaningfully. For investors seeking asymmetric upside in the meme sector, Little Pepe deserves serious consideration. Visit the Little Pepe website or join its Telegram to stay ahead of listings and developments.

        "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-meets-retail-walmart-linked-fintech-expands-into-digital-assets/",
        "body": "OnePay, the fintech linked to Walmart, plans to add crypto trading to its mobile banking app later in 2025, according to multiple reports. Sources told news outlets that users will be able to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) inside the app, a move that would expand OnePay’s lineup of financial services beyond savings and cards. OnePay To Add Crypto Trading Reports have disclosed that the crypto functions will be powered through a tie-up with Zerohash, a firm that provides custody and settlement services for digital assets. That suggests OnePay will rely on outside infrastructure rather than build all systems itself. OnePay was launched in 2021 and is majority owned by Walmart, with early backing from Ribbit Capital, and the company has been steadily rolling out banking features since then. Partnerships And Product Plans OnePay is working with Synchrony to relaunch Walmart’s credit card offerings, and Reuters reported a Synchrony announcement dated June 9, 2025, about card programs set to return this fall. The app also aims to offer savings accounts and buy-now, pay-later options alongside the new crypto window. Users may be given the ability to convert crypto to fiat and then use those funds for purchases in Walmart stores or to pay card balances, though the exact mechanics have not been fully detailed by company spokespeople. How Much Will Users Get Access To At First? Several outlets suggest OnePay will start with the two largest tokens, BTC and ETH, rather than a long list of coins. Limits, fees and state availability were not disclosed in the reports, and those details could change before any public launch. Sources said the rollout is expected sometime later in 2025, with the credit card program arriving in fall 2025, but no firm launch date for crypto trading has been announced. Regulatory Hurdles And Timing Regulators at the state and federal level are actively watching crypto offerings from consumer apps, and compliance requirements could shape how quickly OnePay moves. Based On reports, the company has not publicly filed detailed disclosures tied to the crypto service, and both Walmart and OnePay declined to comment to reporters. That leaves open the possibility of a phased release, restricted to certain users or states at first. What This Means For Shoppers And Users If the plan proceeds, Walmart customers who already use OnePay could gain another way to access BTC and ETH without signing up for a separate crypto exchange. Analysts and users will be watching fees, protections for deposits, and whether the app allows spending crypto directly in stores or requires conversion first.

        "body": "As Solana (SOL) matures, the rapid short-term gains it once offered are becoming harder to replicate. The early-day investors who saw $200 turn into $5,000 have largely exited that window. Newer entrants in 2025 are looking at high-utility early-stage projects and still provide explosive upside. A crypto that already provides such an opportunity is Little Pepe (LILPEPE)—a meme coin that has a real-life blockchain application. Having sold a record presale and increasing token price, Little Pepe is coming out as a top choice. Little Pepe: Ethereum Layer 2, Zero Tax, Staking, and DAO Governance Little Pepe is an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 blockchain with a combination of meme culture and real utility. The project features staking rewards, voting in the DAO, and launching memes, and zero taxation is applied to the trading. Future integrations are NFTs and cross-chain compatibility, expanding its possible application. The LILPEPE ecosystem will be designed to ensure that there is a balance between liquidity, reserves, staking, marketing and CEX preparedness with a total supply of 100 billion tokens. $26.3M raised so far: a clear presale trajectory Since launching its presale on June 10, Little Pepe has advanced through 13 stages, steadily increasing in value. Stage 1 began at $0.001, with subsequent stages climbing by $0.0001 per phase. By Stage 13, now active, the token price has reached $0.0022. To date, $26,382,101 has been raised out of a $28,775,000 target. A total of 16,162,317,775 tokens have already been sold from the 17,250,000,000 allocation. Stage 14 will introduce yet another uptick at $0.0023, which will be a 130% increase compared to the price of Stage 1. This continued flow has placed early investors near breakeven or gaining even before the presale ends, thus showing strong momentum and interest. $777,000 giveaway now live for presale contributors A $777,000 giveaway is currently live to celebrate the presale. Ten winners will receive $77,000 each in $LILPEPE tokens. To enter, participants must contribute at least $100 to the ongoing presale. The promotion is active during presale stages only and also includes random big buyer rewards (15+ ETH) between Stages 12 and 17. Little Pepe presents a new investment window that mirrors the early Solana days. The project shows actual blockchain value with a fast-moving presale, the Layer 2 architecture, zero tax on trading, staking, governance of the project through DAOs, and future NFTs. According to the present momentum and tokenomics, LILPEPE has all the potential to become one of the most successful crypto assets in 2025.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-high-can-ethereum-eth-go-this-uptober-chatgpt-breaks-it-down-and-names-a-cheaper-must-buy-crypto-for-2025/",
        "body": "The Uptober month is already living up to its name, with Ethereum (ETH) returning to the limelight as specialists foresee a possible breakout higher than $5,000, and as high as $5,500. More institutional inflows, optimism regarding the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, and higher Layer-2 adoption are all helping to create bullish momentum for the world’s second-largest altcoin. But while ETH’s potential upside remains strong, investors are becoming more interested in a much more high-upside play, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with far greater growth potential at a fraction of the expense. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance has been one of the most popular DeFi projects in 2025 with its twin lending infrastructure, real-yield mechanics, and non-custodial smart contracts tackling critical inefficiencies of decentralized finance. With Stage 6 of its presale over 55% sold out, 16,750+ holders, and over $16.8 million raised, MUTM could outshine ETH in the next run. Ethereum (ETH) Positions Itself for a Strong Uptober Rally Ethereum (ETH) is positioning itself for a potential explosive rally in October 2025, with prices keeping their strength around $4,300 after a steep bounce above $4,000. October, which is known as “Uptober” among traders, historically comes with average returns of nearly 5%, and this time the setup looks even stronger. Institutional demand is increasing as ETH investment funds attract hundreds of millions of inflows, with big players such as BlackRock ongoing in developing its network. At the same time, 30% of the ETH supply is now staked, locking up coins and removing circulating supply from the network, as deflationary token burns further tighten market dynamics. With exhausted exchange reserves, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the bullish BTC trend, and greater crypto euphoria around key U.S. events, analysts say that a breakout above $5,000 is eminently within the realm of possibility. But although ETH displays dazzling upside, the vast majority of investors seeking greater growth potential are starting to eye Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for out-of-proportion returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge as Investor Frenzy Hits All-Time High Mutuum Finance has been providing early adopters with the special opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a lower cost before the project is officially launched. Phase 6 tokens available at $0.035 have been extremely sought after, presale already reaching over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 owners. The figures say volumes of active market enthusiasm and increasing faith in the future of the long-term business. Besides locking down the platform and engaging with community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program with an official $50,000 USDT bug bounty pool. The program invites white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to report codebase vulnerabilities with rewards paid out depending on severity. This ensures that even the minor problems are addressed as quickly as possible and general platform security is high. Mutuum Finance to Roll Out New DeFi Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has announced the upcoming release of its own lending and borrowing protocol , a giant leap towards decentralized finance. The V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have the fundamental components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Since ETH and USDT are supported from the start for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing, the platform aims to offer a stable and scalable foundation for users of DeFi. To access recent and real-time prices, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles along with high-cap token feeds like USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references are provided, which allow multi-layered functionality to supply robust and secure price data in the face of ultra-abnormal market chaos. Ethereum’s “Uptober” rally may propel ETH to over $5,000, yet its potential is capped compared to the early-stage possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at only $0.035 is already more than 55% sold in phase 6 with $16.8M raised, presents much greater growth potential. Its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield structure, and robust presale traction make MUTM the top DeFi altcoin for investors seeking disproportionate 2025 returns.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/are-these-the-2-best-cryptos-to-buy-as-trump-backed-thumzup-media-expands-dogecoin-mining-with-2-5m-investment/",
        "body": "Thumzup Media, a Trump-backed company, has announced that it has invested $2.5 million in ramping up Dogecoin mining activities with hundreds of additional ASIC rigs and a significant boost in network hash power. The move has rekindled bullish interest in Dogecoin (DOGE), with some speculating that institutional entry may take its price beyond the $1 mark during the next bull run. That said, though DOGE’s momentum is worth keeping an eye on, more seasoned investors are now turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with much greater upside potential. Now at only $0.035, Mutuum Finance has already emerged as one of 2025’s most formidable DeFi plays thanks to its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield tokenomics, and non-custodial smart contract architecture. Presale Stage 6 is already over 55% sold, with more than 16,750 holders and more than $16.8 million raised, all of which are positive indicators of institutional and whale confidence. Mutuum Finance is the smart, utility-backed choice over meme-driven cryptocurrencies like DOGE. Thumzup Media’s $2.5M Investment Has the Potential to Be a Game-Changer for Dogecoin’s Future Dogecoin (DOGE) is winning back institutional confidence after Thumzup Media, a Trump family-supported business, made a substantial $2.5 million investment. The funding will enable DogeHash Technologies to expand its mining capacity exponentially, with over 4,000 mining rigs operational prior to year-end, one of the most extensive Dogecoin mining networks in the U.S. The addition of 500 new high-performance ASIC miners will expand the hash rate of the network, accelerating transaction speed, boosting security, and building further trust in the system as a whole. Thumzup’s entry, signaled by its recent acquisition of 19 BTC and 7.5 million DOGE and eventual investment of as much as $250 million in digital assets, is an indicator of growing institutional interest and confidence in Dogecoin’s long-term potential. Analysts predict the development to catalyze broader institutional uptake and boost DOGE’s position in mainstream crypto portfolios. But as Dogecoin fundamentals keep growing stronger, increasingly more investors are also investigating Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which could offer even greater upside potential beyond the meme-coin narrative. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Traction Mutuum Finance is generating even more hype and anticipation for its presale, with the platform already raising over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 investors onboard to date. Stage 6 of the project is ongoing, during which MUTM tokens are available for purchase at $0.035 per token. In appreciation of early adopters, Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway promotion, in which 10 users will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. The protocol will have a dynamic floating interest rate mechanism that makes the most efficient use of liquidity. Low interest rate environments and excess liquidity environments encourage borrowing and ecosystem activity and high demand environments and higher interest rates encourage loan repayment and incoming capital flows. Fixed interest models function optimally when liquidity is constant, adjusting organically to overall market forces. Mutuum Finance Advances Development of Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance is going ahead with the development of its lending and borrowing protocol , a key step to enhancing its decentralized finance ecosystem. The first version (V1) of the protocol is expected on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will include functionalities such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. ETH and USDT will be supported for lending, borrowing, and collateral at the time of launch, providing users with a convenient and secure DeFi experience. Lending, borrowing, and liquidation at a profit require efficient asset valuation. To this effect, Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to retrieve live USD and principal crypto asset prices such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform realizes optimum data accuracy by utilizing fallback oracle systems, composite data feeds, and time-weighted averages from decentralized exchanges for quality valuations during the highly volatile and distressed market conditions. Dogecoin (DOGE) or Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Dogecoin’s $2.5M mining incentive shows growing interest, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a far more promising prospect. At $0.035 and with over 55% sold, 16,750+ buyers and $16.8M invested, MUTM’s twin lending ecosystem, real-yield tokenomics, and upcoming DeFi protocol render it a utility-based altcoin with tremendous growth potential, which makes DOGE seem like a less desirable option for serious investors.

        "body": "Brazil’s largest investment bank, BTG Pactual’s crypto platform Mynt, has flagged five cryptocurrencies it believes are well-positioned for gains in October: bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), solana (SOL), avalanche (AVAX), and sky (SKY). The picks, outlined in a report authored by Matheus Parizotto and João Galhardo, reflect a broader optimism in the crypto market as U.S. interest rates ease and anticipation builds for new crypto ETFs. Bitcoin remains the dominant institutional pick, with more than $3.5 billion flowing into spot ETFs in September and corporate treasuries adding 43,000 BTC, over $5 billion at current prices. Mynt’s report describes it as a long-term anchor. “For those seeking a long-term pillar in their portfolio, BTC offers liquidity, network security, and a track record of adoption that extends beyond retail investors,” it reads. Ether, it says, continues to lead in on-chain finance. BTG Pactual’s team pointed out the network concentrates the majority of stablecoin volume and real-world asset tokenization projects. Over the last six months, U.S. spot ETFs added $11.3 billion in ETH, while corporate treasuries picked up 816,000 ETH in September alone. To the analysts, these flows show institutional appetite remains elevated. Beyond the top two Solana’s case hinges on speed and cost. The network, BTG Pactual pointed out, processed over $100 billion in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume for the third straight month, while its total value locked surpassed $30 billion for the first time in a sign of deepening DeFi liquidity. The analysts added that institutional demand has been increasing with the potential arrival of new spot SOL ETFs, which could lead to greater flows and visibility. “For those seeking exposure to high-performance infrastructure with growing adoption in real-world cases, Solana combines scale, competitive cost, and an accelerating network effect,” the report reads. For AVAX, BTG Pactual highlighted its sharp growth in on-chain activity, noting that daily transactions increased by 46% and stablecoin transfers rose by 421% over the last quarter. The network’s subnet architecture allows enterprises to spin up custom blockchains, boosting real-world use cases, it said. Sky Protocol, the rebranded MakerDAO, rounds out the list. Its stablecoin, USDS, has a circulating supply of nearly $8 billion, and its Sky Savings Rate offers a variable return that’s currently at 4.75%. Coupled with a token buyback program that’s already deployed $77 million, the report is positioning SKY as a revenue-generating DeFi token with long-term potential.",

        "url": "https://timestabloid.com/heres-what-xrp-market-cap-multiplier-effect-means/",
        "body": "Every crypto bull market has its buzzwords, but few have sparked as much curiosity among XRP holders as the so-called “market cap multiplier effect.” It’s the idea that XRP’s true price potential isn’t limited by its large total supply — because only a fraction of that supply is actively available on the market. In other words, XRP’s liquidity reality may be far smaller than its theoretical supply, meaning smaller inflows of capital could trigger disproportionately large price reactions. Understanding the Market Cap Multiplier In a recent video, Jake Claver, managing partner at Digital Wealth Partners, tackled the growing debate head-on: “People look at total supply of XRP when, in reality, the supply-demand dynamics are going to be on the available supply of XRP,” he explained. This distinction — between XRP’s total supply of 100 billion and the much smaller circulating amount that actually trades — is at the heart of the multiplier effect. Let's look at what the XRP market cap multiplier effect means pic.twitter.com/5tiUdpHt6i — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) October 3, 2025 Claver illustrated this with a practical example: “There might be 2 billion XRP left on exchanges — probably less than that if you include retail and what they’re going to exit or sell.” He added that even if XRP’s price skyrockets to $10, $20, or even $50, some retail investors would inevitably sell portions of their holdings, adding perhaps another billion XRP to the liquid market. But that still represents a small share of total supply. The Math Behind the Multiplier Claver broke down the logic simply: “If you only had, let’s say, 2 billion [XRP] out of 100 billion, you’d be that 50x that Zach Rector talks about. It’s total supply versus available supply — and that’s why you get a shift in how much liquidity moving in is going to cause the market cap to rise in a multiplier effect.” When buyers enter the market, their demand impacts a smaller pool of available tokens, rather than the total supply. This limited float magnifies price movements, which in turn amplifies market capitalization faster than would occur in a fully distributed asset. Institutional Holdings and Market Liquidity Claver also revealed that his firm, Digital Wealth Partners, currently manages around 200 million XRP, accounting for roughly 8% of retail-owned XRP, based on his estimates. This institutional custody further concentrates holdings, reducing the amount of XRP readily available on exchanges. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 “Retail doesn’t hold more than maybe 1.2 to 2 billion total XRP in my opinion,” he said, emphasizing that these liquidity dynamics are critical for understanding XRP’s future price behavior. Broader Context and Implications While the multiplier concept doesn’t change XRP’s total supply — which remains capped at 100 billion — it reframes how market participants should interpret liquidity and price discovery. Ripple’s monthly escrow releases , typically capped at 1 billion XRP, also control how much new supply enters circulation, keeping active liquidity relatively tight. The takeaway is clear: XRP’s potential price response is not purely a function of total supply, but of how much XRP is actually tradable. As Claver summarized, “It’s total supply versus available supply. That’s the reason there is a multiplier effect.” The XRP market cap multiplier effect shows how small changes in liquidity can lead to significant price movements. It’s not speculation — it’s a structural feature of how XRP trades in real-world conditions, where limited availability magnifies every dollar of demand that flows into the asset.

        "body": "Markets have a way of testing conviction before rewarding it. For XRP holders, that moment of quiet before the storm feels closer than ever. After months of sideways consolidation and growing impatience, many analysts now believe XRP is positioning itself for a powerful move — one that could redefine its market trajectory when it finally unfolds. The Setup: Pattern and Price Renowned market observer The Crypto Philosopher recently shared a striking technical comparison between XRP’s current structure and Amazon’s chart from the early 2000s. In the video, XRP’s weekly chart is overlaid with Amazon’s long-term base that preceded its historic 14x rally from $5 to $70. The resemblance, he argues, is no coincidence. A cup-and-handle pattern is emerging in XRP’s chart, a classic bullish setup that typically precedes a significant upward move. According to The Crypto Philosopher, XRP’s current support sits firmly around $2.70, with a critical breakout level near $3.02. A confirmed move above this resistance, especially with increasing trading volume, could ignite a parabolic run — mirroring the way Amazon’s breakout unleashed years of compounding gains. Xrp is on the brink of its parabolic run It’ll happen when you least expect it Just keep waiting pic.twitter.com/laTpiG5nzE — The Crypto Philosopher (@TheCryptoP73649) October 2, 2025 The Amazon Analogy and Its Implications The comparison to Amazon is notable because it suggests XRP is following a similar pattern of accumulation before explosive growth. Just as Amazon built a foundation for years after the dot-com crash, XRP has been laying groundwork despite market doubts and regulatory challenges. While parallels between equities and digital assets should be drawn with caution, the core logic remains: strong fundamentals, persistent development, and an extended consolidation phase can set the stage for substantial upward revaluation. In XRP’s case, the alignment of technical structure, liquidity positioning, and renewed investor sentiment strengthens the bullish argument. The Expected Timeline If the pattern continues to unfold as projected, XRP could be entering the final stretch of its handle formation, a period that typically lasts from several days to a few weeks before a breakout confirmation. Analysts suggest that a decisive close above $3.02 would mark the official start of the next leg up. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From there, momentum could accelerate rapidly, driven by institutional inflows, renewed market confidence, and increased adoption of Ripple’s technologies in real-world payments and tokenization. However, timing remains fluid. True parabolic runs rarely announce themselves in advance. As The Crypto Philosopher aptly noted, “It’ll happen when you least expect it.” Risks and Confirmation Signals Despite the bullish outlook, traders are urged to remain disciplined. False breakouts can occur, especially in a volatile market. To confirm the trend, analysts suggest looking for three key indicators: sustained volume growth, successful retests of new support levels, and overall crypto market strength driven by Bitcoin. In summary, XRP’s technical setup is nearing a crucial inflection point. If price and volume converge as anticipated, the conditions for a parabolic surge could soon align — turning patience into payoff for long-term believers. Yet, as every seasoned trader knows, conviction must be matched with caution, because even the most promising charts demand validation before the real run begins.

        "body": "In the world of digital assets, momentum can shift in an instant. A single technical signal—especially on a higher-timeframe chart—can mark the difference between quiet consolidation and explosive upside. For XRP, that moment may be near. Analysts are closely monitoring the charts, where a rare combination of bullish signals is emerging, suggesting a potential price breakout could be imminent. Cryptoinsightuk Flags Bullish RSI Signal Market analyst Cryptoinsightuk has sounded the alarm for XRP holders, noting that the asset’s three-day chart is now showing a bullish Relative Strength Index (RSI) crossover alongside a strong three-day candle close. The analyst emphasized that this particular alignment has preceded major upward moves for XRP in the past—pointing to the last three instances on November 5, 2024, April 19, 2025, and June 27, 2025. We are in the territory where we could see a pop to the upside for $XRP at any point imo. We got a great 3 Day candle close yesterday and bullish cross on the 3 day RSI. Here are the last 3 times we saw this happen pic.twitter.com/NzPHCMjvqS — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) October 4, 2025 Each of those historical signals coincided with significant bullish momentum, suggesting the current setup could mark the beginning of another leg higher. “We are in the territory where we could see a pop to the upside for XRP at any point,” Cryptoinsightuk wrote, reinforcing that the chart structure remains technically constructive. Understanding the Technical Setup A bullish RSI crossover occurs when short-term momentum breaks above its longer-term trend line—an early indication that buying pressure is starting to dominate. When this signal appears on the three-day timeframe, it’s more significant than similar signals on shorter intervals because it indicates sustained market strength rather than short-term volatility. Coupled with the recent strong candle close, this crossover suggests that bulls are regaining control after a period of consolidation. Historically, such alignments on XRP’s chart have led to strong continuation rallies, provided they are confirmed by volume and price action in subsequent sessions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Resistance Levels and Market Context From a technical perspective, XRP faces its next resistance band between $3.20 and $3.65, a region that has repeatedly capped price advances in 2025. A decisive breakout and sustained close above that zone could unlock further upside momentum , potentially validating the “pop” scenario that traders like Cryptoinsightuk anticipate. Broader market conditions also favor bullish sentiment. Bitcoin remains strong above six-figure levels, overall liquidity has improved across digital assets, and institutional participation in on-chain settlement projects continues to grow. These factors collectively create an environment in which XRP could benefit from renewed investor confidence. Risk and Confirmation While optimism is building, analysts caution that no technical indicator guarantees results. RSI crossovers can produce false signals if volume fails to confirm or if sudden macro news shifts sentiment. Traders are advised to manage risk carefully, watch for volume-supported breakouts, and avoid over-leveraging positions during volatility spikes. The Bottom Line With momentum indicators in sync and historical patterns resurfacing, XRP seems poised for a potential breakout. As Cryptoinsightuk highlights, the market is once again positioned where a strong upward move could emerge at any time. Whether that surge materializes will depend on confirmation in the coming days—but for now, XRP sits squarely in what analysts call breakout territory .

        "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp/",
        "body": "An alarming pattern of XRP whale activity has been noted, posing several questions about the sustainability of the cryptocurrency’s growth. Among the multiple questions currently being asked, one is more demanding of an immediate response: Is an XRP whale sell-off on its way? XRP Supply Surges Across Major Exchanges In an October 3rd post on the social media platform X, market analyst CryptoOnchain highlighted a recent shift in the behavior of XRP’s largest holders, the whales. The online pundit’s report was based on the Exchange Supply Ratio indicator, which tracks the proportion of XRP tokens on exchanges relative to its total circulating supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Exchange Inflows Hit $5.7B: Profit-Taking Already Underway? This metric can be used to derive insights on potential selling pressure for a crypto asset (XRP, in this case), seeing as higher values would suggest increased availability of tokens on the exchange for sale. According to CryptoOnchain, there has been a spike in XRP supply across major exchanges, suggesting that whales might be positioning for a significant sell-off. The data shared reflects the increase in selling pressure across these exchanges, including Bithumb, Bitget, Bitfinex, and Binance, putting the XRP price at an increased risk of a sharp correction. XRP Displays Bearish Divergence As Sellers Dominate Futures Market In a separate post made on the CryptoQuant platform, CryptoOnchain also revealed a budding negative divergence across the XRP futures market. The relevant indicator here is the Taker Buy Sell Ratio metric, which monitors the balance between aggressive buy and sell orders in the futures market. This metric is typically used to assess whether buyers or sellers are dominating the market in the short term. The analyst noted that while the price of XRP has been mostly around $3 after its recent rise, the ‘Taker Ratio’ across exchanges has fallen to its lowest level since November 2024. Interestingly, data from Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, further supports this bearish signal, as patterns similar to those seen on other exchanges have also been surfacing. Related Reading: Ethereum Matches Bitcoin In Annual Gains: What This Means For The Market CryptoOnchain explained that this situation could either mean that the market participants are booking profits or anticipating a price decline in the near future. However, the spike in XRP supply across major crypto exchanges, alongside the clear dominance of sellers in the perpetual futures market, strongly suggests the imminence of a price correction. It is therefore advisable to watch the psychological $3 level closely before market decisions are made. As of this writing, XRP is hovering around the $3 mark, reflecting a nearly 2% decline in the past 24 hours. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView",

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/celestia-price-prediction/",
        "body": "Key Takeaways : The Celestia price prediction for 2025 suggests a maximum price of $21.22. By 2028, TIA could attain a maximum price of $64.46 and an average price of $56.11. In 2031, the TIA price forecast expects a maximum price of $156.88. Celestia generated significant interest before its October 2023 launch. This was largely due to the strong backing from major crypto exchanges from the outset and the intriguing technical concepts behind the Celestia modular blockchain network. In this article, we’ll provide a Celestia price prediction, analyze the factors driving these projections, and explore what the Celestia modular blockchain network brings to the broader crypto landscape. Overview Cryptocurrency Celestia Token TIA Price $1.47 (-1.8%) Market cap $1.68 Billion Trading volume (24-hour) $87.3 Million Circulating supply 639.85 Million TIA All-time high $20.91; Feb 10, 2024 All-time low $2.03; Oct 31, 2023 24-hour high $1.6 24-hour low $1.38 TIA price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $ 1.47 Price Prediction $ 1.10 (-25.15%) Fear & Greed Index 71 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 9.65% Green Days 16/30 (53%) 50-Day SMA $ 1.66 200-Day SMA $ 2.28 14-Day RSI 44.76 TIA price analysis: TIA price faces a selling pressure toward $1.45 TIA price analysis shows volatility toward $1.45 Resistance for TIA is present at $1.587 Support for TIA/USD is present at $1.325 The TIA price analysis for October 4 confirms that TIA is witnessing bearish volatility toward the $1.45 level. Currently, buyers are controlling the price chart around support lines. TIA price analysis 1-day chart: TIA price faces minor selling pressure Analyzing the daily Celestia price chart, TIA price is facing rising bearish momentum as sellers pushed the price toward $1.45. The recent highs triggered selling pressure, resulting in a decline below immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume declined to $12.6 million, showing a slight decrease in trading activity today. TIA is trading at $1.46, declining by over 1.8% in the last 24 hours. TIA/USD chart. Image source: TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and hovers around the 42-level, showing that bears are controlling the momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests lower volatility for the next few hours. TIA/USD 4-hour price chart: Bears aim for a hold below moving averages The 4-hour TIA price chart suggests TIA continues to experience intense volatility between $1 and $1.5, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. Currently, bears aim for a strong domination as the price prepares for a hold below EMA lines. TIA/USD chart. Image source: TradingView The BoP indicator is bullish at 0, suggesting that buyers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost upward correction. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening bearish positions.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent TIA prices from an immediate surge. However, if the TIA price successfully breaks above $1.587, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $1.938. TIA/USD chart. Image source: TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, the TIA price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.325, resulting in a correction to $1.106. Is TIA a good investment? Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price is attempting to hold below $1.5 as buyers lost confidence, resulting in a decline below Fib channels. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. It is advised to do own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile crypto market.

As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $1.2 and a maximum of $2.3, with an average of $1.8. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction October 2025 $1.2 $1.8 $2.3 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $1, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

Some of these investors might be waiting for the price surge triggered by the Bitcoin Halving to maximize their profits. Consequently, there could be significant downward pressure on the price of TIA as it reaches its peak moment. According to price forecast and technical analysis, Celestia’s price is forecasted to range from a minimum of $25.58 to a maximum of $30.48 in 2026, with an average trading price of $26.32.

        "url": "https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-is-btc-about-to-explode-to-130k-this-week-2/",
        "body": "Bitcoin has extended its rally after a clean breakout from the descending channel, reclaiming primary structural levels and driving toward the $122K–$124K all-time high. While momentum remains strongly bullish, the market is still exposed to a brief pullback toward $114K–$118K to rebalance before any potential continuation toward new highs. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin has continued its upward expansion, breaking through the mid-range resistance and invalidating the prior descending structure that defined September’s price action. The breakout was followed by a rapid move into the upper boundary of the macro range, likely targeting the buy-side liquidity just above the all-time high around $124K. The price is now holding above the breakout level around $116K–$118K, with the previous decision point at $112K–$114K serving as key support in case of a retracement. Holding above this zone maintains the bullish structure, keeping the $124K–$125K region, where the next liquidity pool sits, as the primary upside target. Momentum indicators, however, suggest the potential for a short-term corrective move before continuation, allowing the market to build a healthier base for another impulsive leg higher. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart The recent surge from the $108K demand zone triggered an impulsive rally that left behind several unmitigated areas of interest. The breaker block at $115K–$117K and the Fibonacci retracement cluster between $114.4K and $113.1K now mark the nearest re-entry zones for buyers. A controlled pullback toward these levels would likely attract renewed demand for continuation toward $124K, where the next major buy-side liquidity cluster lies. If price maintains its current momentum, a sweep above $124K could occur before a corrective phase, aligning with the broader bullish expansion structure as long as the market holds above $111K–$112K. Source: TradingView Sentiment Analysis By Shayan Bitcoin’s open interest on Binance has reached a new record, edging past the August peak of $14.306B. This surge coincides with the latest rally, as BTC has climbed from $108K to $124K, while open interest has expanded from $11.5B to $14.3B in just a few weeks. The parallel rise in both price and open interest confirms that the move has been powered by fresh inflows and new position openings, rather than a short-covering squeeze. This expansion highlights strong conviction from traders on both sides, with institutional and retail participation adding depth to the market. However, the sheer scale of leverage now in play introduces risk. Elevated open interest often acts as a double-edged sword: it can amplify upside moves as trapped shorts unwind, but it can just as quickly trigger liquidation cascades if price momentum stalls. For now, the structure favors continuation, with BTC pressing into new liquidity zones between $125K and $130K. Yet, the danger lies in the market’s fragility. If Bitcoin fails to extend higher and consolidates while open interest stays elevated, the likelihood of a sharp flush grows, potentially dragging price back toward key demand zones before the broader bullish trend resumes. In short, record-high open interest reflects both confidence and vulnerability. Traders should closely watch whether open interest continues rising or starts to unwind, as this will determine if the next leg extends smoothly into $130K or if a leverage-driven shakeout interrupts the rally.

        "body": "Key Takeaways: Our Ordinals price prediction anticipates a high of $29.81 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $8 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $8.32 Market cap $174.77M 24-hour trading volume $38.73M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2024 24-hour high $8.95 24-hour low $8.18 Ordi price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 8.87% 50-day SMA $9.05 200-day SMA $9.34 Sentiment Bearish Green days 16/30 (53%) Fear and Greed Index 71 (Greed) Ordi price analysis On the day of writing (October 4), ORDI’s price dropped by 5.51% in 24 hours and 0.11% in the last seven days. Its trading volume dropped by 17.16% showing less trader conviction in the market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades along the Williams alligator trendlines, signaling an uneventful market as the price bounced off support levels ($7.70 Fibonacci midpoint) and key moving averages. The coin has registered negative momentum in the last 7 days. The MACD and signal lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, signaling a bear market. At the same time, the relative strength index is in neutral territory at 44.51. It is oversold when the RSI falls below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI is moving sideways at the $8.39 mark with MACD confirmation (-0.029). The William Alligator trendlines show falling volatility. ORDI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 8.69 SELL SMA 5 8.40 SELL SMA 10 8.46 SELL SMA 21 9.09 SELL SMA 50 9.05 SELL SMA 100 9.17 SELL SMA 200 9.34 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 8.78 SELL EMA 5 8.85 SELL EMA 10 8.91 SELL EMA 21 9.05 SELL EMA 50 9.17 SELL EMA 100 9.38 SELL EMA 200 11.87 SELL What to expect from ORDI price analysis next? ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. Over the short term, ORDI remains correlated with Bitcoin, which is just below $122,000. The charts show it will continue downwards but with less volatility. Why is ORDI down? ORDI’s drop reflects technical triggers, Bitcoin-driven risk aversion, and technical overextension. Its status as a “Bitcoin beta” leaves it exposed during dominance rallies, while thin liquidity magnifies moves. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10. In October, it traded above the $8 mark.",

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-high-can-ethereum-eth-go-this-uptober-chatgpt-breaks-it-down-and-names-a-cheaper-must-buy-crypto-for-2025/",
        "body": "The Uptober month is already living up to its name, with Ethereum (ETH) returning to the limelight as specialists foresee a possible breakout higher than $5,000, and as high as $5,500. More institutional inflows, optimism regarding the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, and higher Layer-2 adoption are all helping to create bullish momentum for the world’s second-largest altcoin. But while ETH’s potential upside remains strong, investors are becoming more interested in a much more high-upside play, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with far greater growth potential at a fraction of the expense. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance has been one of the most popular DeFi projects in 2025 with its twin lending infrastructure, real-yield mechanics, and non-custodial smart contracts tackling critical inefficiencies of decentralized finance. With Stage 6 of its presale over 55% sold out, 16,750+ holders, and over $16.8 million raised, MUTM could outshine ETH in the next run. Ethereum (ETH) Positions Itself for a Strong Uptober Rally Ethereum (ETH) is positioning itself for a potential explosive rally in October 2025, with prices keeping their strength around $4,300 after a steep bounce above $4,000. October, which is known as “Uptober” among traders, historically comes with average returns of nearly 5%, and this time the setup looks even stronger. Institutional demand is increasing as ETH investment funds attract hundreds of millions of inflows, with big players such as BlackRock ongoing in developing its network. At the same time, 30% of the ETH supply is now staked, locking up coins and removing circulating supply from the network, as deflationary token burns further tighten market dynamics. With exhausted exchange reserves, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, the bullish BTC trend, and greater crypto euphoria around key U.S. events, analysts say that a breakout above $5,000 is eminently within the realm of possibility. But although ETH displays dazzling upside, the vast majority of investors seeking greater growth potential are starting to eye Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for out-of-proportion returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge as Investor Frenzy Hits All-Time High Mutuum Finance has been providing early adopters with the special opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a lower cost before the project is officially launched. Phase 6 tokens available at $0.035 have been extremely sought after, presale already reaching over $16.8 million and having over 16,750 owners. The figures say volumes of active market enthusiasm and increasing faith in the future of the long-term business. Besides locking down the platform and engaging with community members, Mutuum Finance also partnered with CertiK to create an official Bug Bounty Program with an official $50,000 USDT bug bounty pool. The program invites white-hat hackers, security researchers, and developers to report codebase vulnerabilities with rewards paid out depending on severity. This ensures that even the minor problems are addressed as quickly as possible and general platform security is high. Mutuum Finance to Roll Out New DeFi Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has announced the upcoming release of its own lending and borrowing protocol , a giant leap towards decentralized finance. The V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have the fundamental components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. Since ETH and USDT are supported from the start for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing, the platform aims to offer a stable and scalable foundation for users of DeFi. To access recent and real-time prices, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles along with high-cap token feeds like USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite data feeds, and on-chain price references are provided, which allow multi-layered functionality to supply robust and secure price data in the face of ultra-abnormal market chaos. Ethereum’s “Uptober” rally may propel ETH to over $5,000, yet its potential is capped compared to the early-stage possibilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at only $0.035 is already more than 55% sold in phase 6 with $16.8M raised, presents much greater growth potential. Its dual lending ecosystem, real-yield structure, and robust presale traction make MUTM the top DeFi altcoin for investors seeking disproportionate 2025 returns.

        "body": "Key takeaways: Our ARB predictions anticipate a high of $0.82 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $1.01 and $1.22, with an average price of $1.04. In 2030, it will range between $2.98 and $3.51, with an average price of $3.08. Layer 2s have made quite a buzz over the last few months because of their high network activity. Arbitrum led the Layer 2 pack with a total value locked ( TVL ) of $2.53 billion. Arbitrum is an Optimistic Rollup solution that shifts network operations away from the Ethereum mainnet while maintaining Ethereum-level security. Arbitrum’s BOLD testnet also went live; when integrated into the mainnet, the update will enable permissionless validation on Arbitrum. This means that anyone can challenge the state of the Arbitrum network. Currently, validators are allow-listed. Is Arbitrum a good investment? Will it go up? Where will it be in 5 years? Let’s answer these questions and more in our Arbitrum price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Arbitrum Ticker ARB Current price $0.4326 Market cap $2.33B Trading volume $207.99 Circulating supply 5.4B All-time high $2.40 on Jan 12, 2024 All-time low $0.245 on Apr 7, 2025 24-hour high $0.4563 24-hour low $0.4274 Arbitrum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 8.68% 50-day SMA $0.4877 200-day SMA $0.4111 Sentiment Bearish Green days 14/30 (47%) Fear and Greed Index 71 (Greed) Arbitrum price analysis On October 4, Arbitrum’s price rose by 3.14% over 24 hours to $0.4326, while its trading volume decreased by 32.38% during the same period. Looking back, ARB had a steep decline in April, which saw it register its lowest price since launch at $0.245. It has since recovered the losses. ARB 1-day chart analysis ARBUSD chart by TradingView ARB has support at $0.4085 and trades below major SMA and EMA levels, signaling a bearish market. The MACD histogram (0.0009) confirms little momentum, while the RSI (42.57) is in neutral territory. It is oversold when the value drops below 30. The drop comes after ARB broke below $0.4870 last month. Arbitrum price 4-hour chart price analysis ARBUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that ARB registers negative momentum and that its volatility is dropping. The charts’ short candles are indicative of a bear market. The MACD histograms show its negative momentum rose over the last 16 hours.

ARB’s dip reflects natural profit-taking after a strong quarter and shifting focus toward competing L2 developments. While the network’s fundamentals (DeFi dominance, Robinhood’s RWA integrations) remain intact, traders are cautiously awaiting clearer signals. Why is ARB down? ARB’s decline reflects a mix of technical breakdowns while ecosystem developments like VanEck’s ETF provide long-term upside; near-term risks dominate. Recent news SWIFT announced its blockchain will use Linea (Ethereum L2), challenging Arbitrum’s dominance in institutional adoption. Linea’s TVL ($2.27B) now ranks fourth among L2s. Does Arbitrum have a future? A high adoption rate is crucial for any blockchain’s long-term success and sustainability. Arbitrum’s performance in this regard is a positive sign of its future performance despite the price declines. Is Arbitrum good to buy? Arbitrum is trading at its lowest range this year, with the charts showing it is just above the oversold region. At current prices, ARB is undervalued and is likely to recover if market sentiment changes. On the other hand, the Arbitrum ecosystem’s total value locked has crossed above $2.5 billion, indicating solid utility in decentralized finance. Is Arbitrum a good investment? SkyEcosystem’s Risk Analysis has launched USDS stablecoin on Arbitrum, expanding Arbitrum’s utility, which will attract liquidity to the network. This integration could increase ARB usage, potentially boosting its price. Will Arbitrum reach $10? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ARB is unlikely to reach $10 before 2031. Can Arbitrum reach 100 dollars? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $100 in the period ending in 2031. Will Arbitrum reach $1,000? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $1,000 in the period ending in 2031. Does Arbitrum have a good long-term future? A high adoption rate is crucial for any blockchain’s long-term success and sustainability. Arbitrum’s performance in this regard is a positive sign of its future performance despite the price declines.

        "body": "Markets have a way of testing conviction before rewarding it. For XRP holders, that moment of quiet before the storm feels closer than ever. After months of sideways consolidation and growing impatience, many analysts now believe XRP is positioning itself for a powerful move — one that could redefine its market trajectory when it finally unfolds. The Setup: Pattern and Price Renowned market observer The Crypto Philosopher recently shared a striking technical comparison between XRP’s current structure and Amazon’s chart from the early 2000s. In the video, XRP’s weekly chart is overlaid with Amazon’s long-term base that preceded its historic 14x rally from $5 to $70. The resemblance, he argues, is no coincidence. A cup-and-handle pattern is emerging in XRP’s chart, a classic bullish setup that typically precedes a significant upward move. According to The Crypto Philosopher, XRP’s current support sits firmly around $2.70, with a critical breakout level near $3.02. A confirmed move above this resistance, especially with increasing trading volume, could ignite a parabolic run — mirroring the way Amazon’s breakout unleashed years of compounding gains. Xrp is on the brink of its parabolic run It’ll happen when you least expect it Just keep waiting pic.twitter.com/laTpiG5nzE — The Crypto Philosopher (@TheCryptoP73649) October 2, 2025 The Amazon Analogy and Its Implications The comparison to Amazon is notable because it suggests XRP is following a similar pattern of accumulation before explosive growth. Just as Amazon built a foundation for years after the dot-com crash, XRP has been laying groundwork despite market doubts and regulatory challenges. While parallels between equities and digital assets should be drawn with caution, the core logic remains: strong fundamentals, persistent development, and an extended consolidation phase can set the stage for substantial upward revaluation. In XRP’s case, the alignment of technical structure, liquidity positioning, and renewed investor sentiment strengthens the bullish argument. The Expected Timeline If the pattern continues to unfold as projected, XRP could be entering the final stretch of its handle formation, a period that typically lasts from several days to a few weeks before a breakout confirmation. Analysts suggest that a decisive close above $3.02 would mark the official start of the next leg up.

However, timing remains fluid. True parabolic runs rarely announce themselves in advance. As The Crypto Philosopher aptly noted, “It’ll happen when you least expect it.” Risks and Confirmation Signals Despite the bullish outlook, traders are urged to remain disciplined. False breakouts can occur, especially in a volatile market. To confirm the trend, analysts suggest looking for three key indicators: sustained volume growth, successful retests of new support levels, and overall crypto market strength driven by Bitcoin. In summary, XRP’s technical setup is nearing a crucial inflection point. If price and volume converge as anticipated, the conditions for a parabolic surge could soon align — turning patience into payoff for long-term believers. Yet, as every seasoned trader knows, conviction must be matched with caution, because even the most promising charts demand validation before the real run begins.

        "body": "Bitcoin continues to draw global attention as analysts keep projecting new highs before the end of the year. With institutional accumulation and retail adoption increasing, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is still set for further growth. Forecasts indicate that Bitcoin could soon clear resistance zones last seen in August, which is promising for the entire crypto sector. Yet, even while Bitcoin solidifies its dominance, investors are tapping the market for opportunities with a higher return potential. This search has pushed MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale project already gaining momentum. With the speculation of a listing price of $0.007, community-driven growth has led to talk of bringing 100x ROI in less than a year. Bitcoin (BTC) Holds Strong at $122K and Technical Indicators Bitcoin has risen by 2% in the last 24 hours, trading at $122,300 at press time. This extends a 12% weekly gain. The move outperformed the market-wide 1.9% rise by the overall crypto sector, cementing this coin’s status as a trendsetter. Source: CoinMarketCap Institutional activity continues to gain ground for Bitcoin’s case. Public miners Marathon Digital and CleanSpark increased their treasuries in September. CleanSpark added 184 BTC, and Marathon increased reserves to 52,850 BTC, worth $6.4 billion. Disposal by both firms featured minimal sales and an emphasis on accumulation. By this strategy, the circulating supply is reduced, signaling confidence in a long-term value. Marathon’s expansion into AI and data infrastructure offers resilience to its operations. With several sources of revenue, the company does not heavily rely on the liquidation of BTC. Such institutional positioning gives credence to Bitcoin as a store of value. Retail adoption is another driver. Walmart-backed fintech OnePay announced plans to integrate Bitcoin trading to its mobile app by late 2025. With access to Walmart’s 150 million weekly customers, Bitcoin could have new use cases in retail payments. Enabling crypto-to-fiat conversions at checkout facilitates a payment bridge like Cash App’s, which historically led to increased transaction-driven adoption. From a technical point of view, Bitcoin has regained the $120K, moving above its 7-day SMA & 30-day EMA. The MACD histogram exploded to +688, its strongest signal since August highs. RSI is at 66.48, which indicates there is still momentum before overbought conditions develop. Analysts are targeting Fibonacci extensions at $124,451 and then $128,733 as the next resistance levels. Sustained closes above $122K may clear the path to retesting August’s record high near $125K. MAGACOIN FINANCE Forecast to Deliver 100x ROI by Next Year While Bitcoin’s climb reinforces its role as the market’s anchor, investors are increasingly turning their attention to opportunities with higher upside. That search has brought MAGACOIN FINANCE into the spotlight. Trading at a low price, the project is being hailed as one of 2025’s most promising tokens, with forecasts projecting a staggering 100x return by next year. The contrast is clear. Bitcoin offers stability and institutional adoption, but MAGACOIN FINANCE appeals to those seeking exponential growth. Speculation around a potential exchange listing has only amplified the excitement, suggesting that early participants could benefit from a surge in liquidity and demand once trading begins. Community momentum adds another dimension. Investor groups across Telegram and X have been buzzing with updates and coordinated buying strategies, echoing the grassroots energy that has fueled past breakout tokens. For many retail participants, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the kind of l ow-cost, high-reward opportunity that Bitcoin once offered in its early years. As Bitcoin tests resistance near $125K, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its own narrative, one centered on accessibility and the possibility of turning small allocations into transformative gains within the next cycle. Conclusion Bitcoin’s resilience underscores its strength as a dominant market force. With institutional miners accumulating, retail adoption expanding, and bullish technical indicators, the coin remains well-positioned for growth. However, the upside is moderated by its large market cap, making exponential returns less likely compared to smaller tokens. That is where MAGACOIN FINANCE steps in. With a forecasted $0.007 listing price and strong community engagement, it presents a unique opportunity for outsized returns. For investors balancing stability and growth potential, combining Bitcoin’s resilience with MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive trajectory may shape one of the most compelling strategies of 2025.
