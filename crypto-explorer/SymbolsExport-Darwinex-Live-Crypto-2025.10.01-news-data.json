        "body": "Stocks printed fresh records and gold is on a tear crossing $3,900, but the last leg higher in traditional markets left bitcoin (BTC) behind. The largest crypto, often touted as digital gold, has been stuck in a $100,000–$120,000 range for nearly three months after setting new highs in July and August. The lag fits a pattern. Over the past couple of years, gold and bitcoin have taken turns: when gold breaks out, bitcoin tends to consolidate; when gold cools, BTC often resumes the advance. From January into April, BTC plunged about 30% while gold kicked off its next leg, rising roughly 28% to $3,500 at the height of the global tariff tantrum. Gold then stalled into August, and bitcoin took the baton, rallying about 60% from trough to peak to notch fresh records. Bitcoin to catch up when gold tires \"Gold likes low rates and a weak economy, whereas bitcoin likes them firm,\" said Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree, in a recent report . \"Because bitcoin likes a super strong economy, and low rates are associated with economic slumps.\" He added that the BTC–gold relationship is loose: the 90-day correlation has averaged around 0.1 — \"basically zero.\" Right now, gold is in a lockout rally toward $4,000, up about 17% across a seven-week winning streak. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is still ranging below $120,000. If the recent rhythm holds, a pause in gold, or even a sideways drift, could be the tell for BTC’s next break out of the range and another run at records. \"The good news for bitcoin is that sooner or later, gold will get tired,\" Morris said.",

        "body": "The US Treasury Department is preparing to ease controversial regulations regarding taxes companies must pay on cryptocurrency profits. According to reports, a proposal to require companies to pay billions of dollars in taxes on unrealized Bitcoin gains under the Biden-era Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) will be withdrawn as of October 1. The CAMT requires large companies to pay a tax of at least 15% on their reported income. Currently, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requires companies to “account at market value” for crypto assets. This means that when the price of Bitcoin rises, companies are forced to record their paper gains as income. This poses a huge tax burden for Michael Saylor's company, Strategy, which holds approximately $73 billion in Bitcoin reserves. However, unrealized gains on traditional assets like stocks are exempt from taxation. Related News: Daha Önceki ABD Hükümet Kapanmalarında Bitcoin (BTC) Fiyatı Nasıl Tepki Vermişti? İşte Mutlaka Bilinmesi Gerekenler Strategy and Coinbase, opposing this differential treatment, sent a joint letter to the Treasury Department last May requesting that cryptocurrency profits be exempted. The companies argued that taxing paper profits would force companies to sell Bitcoin just to pay taxes, making it difficult for American companies to compete globally and potentially creating constitutional issues due to the “tax on non-existent income.” *This is not investment advice.

        "body": "World Liberty Fi is exploring different ways to adopt real-world assets (RWAs) and link them to its native and dollar-backed stablecoin, USD1. During the Token2049 event, which is taking place in Singapore, Zach Witkoff said that WLFi is actively working on integrating tokenized assets. Witkoff, who is the CEO of World Liberty Fi, expressed his thoughts and said, “I think commodities are a really interesting area for us, whether it be oil, gas, things like cotton, timber, all of those things, frankly, should be traded on chain.” He confirmed that the WLFi wants to tokenize such assets and link them to USD1 because RWAs require trustworthy and transparent stablecoins. Witkof added, “We’ve not only thought about it, we’re actively working on it.” Trump Jr. believes stablecoins preserve the dollar Donald Trump Jr. believes the rise of stablecoins strengthens the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. He explained that the growing demand for dollar-backed tokens supports US Treasuries at a time when conventional buyers such as China and Japan have reduced their exposure. “Crypto is actually going to be the thing that preserves dollar hegemony around the world,” said Trump Jr. in Singapore during a meeting. The GENIUS Act, which was passed in July, boosted confidence among stablecoin issuers and investors. Cryptopolitan reported that the stablecoin market has expanded to a new all-time high (ATH) of almost $300 billion. And around 99% of this money is in US dollar pegged stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. According to Trump Jr, this concentration shows that stablecoin users worldwide are reinforcing demand for the dollar itself. USD1 ranks sixth among other stablecoins USD1 has grown to become the sixth-largest stablecoin based on data from CoinGecko. The token has a market cap of $2.68 billion and is trading on various networks, including Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum, Solana, and Tron. The majority of the USD1 token supply is available on the BSC chain. World Liberty Financial also has WLFI, a governance token that empowers users. Together, USD1 and WLFI form the core of its ecosystem. The team is planning more products. A debit card is expected to launch between late 2025 and early 2026. A mobile app and wallet system are also in development. The Trump family continues to expand in the crypto space. Recently, Trump Jr, along with his brother Eric, launched a mining company called American Bitcoin. The company trades on Nasdaq under the ticker ABTC. Its stock closed at $7.20, up 6.82%.

        "body": "Solana staking ETF: Solana’s much shorter unstaking window can reduce redemption delays, giving Solana-based staking ETFs a practical advantage over Ethereum products when issuers must return assets quickly during high demand. Shorter unstaking on Solana reduces redemption risk for staking ETFs. Ethereum’s long exit queue and recent spikes in pending withdrawals create potential liquidity and cost challenges for ETF issuers. Onchain data shows Ethereum’s exit queue measured in millions of ETH, increasing average exit times and pressure on fund redemptions. Solana staking ETF advantage: Solana’s faster unstaking can ease ETF redemptions ahead of October SEC decisions — read analysis and implications now. What gives Solana an edge over Ethereum for staking ETFs? Solana staking ETF proponents argue the network’s shorter unstaking period lowers redemptions risk, enabling issuers to return assets faster. That operational difference matters for ETFs that must meet redemption timelines and reduces reliance on costly liquidity solutions. How do unstaking periods affect ETF redemptions? Unstaking periods determine how quickly an issuer can convert staked assets back to liquid tokens for investor redemptions. Ethereum’s exit queue has grown substantially — early September saw an entry queue peak near 860,369 ETH, while exit backlogs exceeded two million ETH, producing average wait times measured in weeks. By contrast, Solana’s unstaking typically clears faster, lowering the probability of delayed redemptions and the need for expensive credit facilities or complex liquidity overlays. Onchain data and issuer statements highlight these operational differences as a major consideration for product design and investor protection. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Solana’s shorter unstaking window may give it an advantage over Ethereum for staking ETFs\", \"image\": [\"https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a0c5-8814-7f83-a167-1aff2a62caf5.webp\"], \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-01T08:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-01T08:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png\" } }, \"description\": \"Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley says Solana’s shorter unstaking period gives it an advantage over Ethereum in the staking ETF race as the SEC readies October rulings.\"} Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley says Solana’s shorter unstaking period gives it an advantage over Ethereum in the race for staking ETFs, as US regulators prepare key decisions in October. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said Solana may gain an edge over Ethereum in the staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, pointing to Solana’s design as more favorable for issuers who must meet tight redemption timelines. Speaking at Token2049 in Singapore, Horsley emphasized that Solana’s quicker unstaking window can materially reduce delays. He noted that Ethereum’s withdrawal queue recently reached new highs and that extended exit backlogs create meaningful operational challenges for ETF issuers. “It’s a huge problem,” Horsley said. “The ETFs need to be able to return assets on a very short time frame. So this is a huge challenge.” Staking requires locking tokens to secure a network and earn rewards. Locked assets face withdrawal timing constraints that vary by protocol and network demand. These constraints directly affect an ETF issuer’s ability to honor redemptions without maintaining large liquidity buffers. Horsley explained that Ethereum-based products can use alternatives — for example, credit facilities to fund redemptions or liquid staking tokens such as stETH — but those workarounds carry costs and capacity limits. He cited Bitwise’s European Ethereum staking ETP approach that uses a credit facility to preserve redemption liquidity as an example of necessary mitigation. Horsley’s remarks follow onchain metrics that tracked the Ethereum staking entry queue near 860,369 ETH in early September and showed the current ETH staking queue at 201,984 ETH with an average wait of about three days for entry. The exit queue has been longer, with figures indicating more than 2 million staked tokens awaiting withdrawal, translating into average exit times measured in weeks. When will the SEC decide on SOL and ETH ETFs? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is scheduled to make decisions on multiple pending Solana and Ethereum ETF filings in October. Several asset managers amended S-1 filings to include staking provisions as they prepare for regulatory review. Notable proposals referenced in filings include applications from Bitwise, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, CoinShares, Grayscale Investments, Canary Capital, and VanEck for Solana ETFs with staking features. The SEC delayed decisions on certain Ether staking approvals to late October; BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust staking approval was pushed to Oct. 30. Source: Nate Geraci Why do issuers consider credit facilities and liquid staking tokens? Issuers use credit facilities to bridge redemptions while staked assets remain illiquid, but these facilities increase cost and create capacity constraints. Liquid staking tokens — such as popular liquid derivatives in the market — offer another workaround by giving holders tradable claims on staked positions. Both approaches are practical but imperfect: credit facilities add financial overhead; liquid staking tokens can introduce basis and protocol risk. Regulators and issuers must weigh these trade-offs in product approvals and disclosures. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to assess unstaking risk for staking ETFs\", \"description\": \"A short procedure to evaluate protocol unstaking timelines and ETF redemption risk.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Check unstaking windows\", \"text\": \"Review the network’s documented unstaking and exit queue behavior and average wait times.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Examine onchain metrics\", \"text\": \"Use onchain data to measure current entry and exit queues, pending withdrawals, and recent spikes.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Evaluate liquidity overlays\", \"text\": \"Assess the issuer’s planned liquidity facilities, costs, and capacity constraints for redemptions.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Consider liquid staking alternatives\", \"text\": \"Determine the role and risks of liquid staking tokens or derivative products in the ETF structure.\" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Will Solana ETFs be easier to redeem than Ethereum ETFs? Typically yes: Solana’s shorter unstaking periods can enable faster redemptions, reducing reliance on credit facilities. However, product design, liquidity arrangements, and market stress scenarios will ultimately determine practical redemption speed. How long are Ethereum exit queues currently? Onchain data showed entry peaks near 860,369 ETH in early September, an active queue around 201,984 ETH for entry, and exit backlogs exceeding two million ETH, producing average exit waits of several weeks. Can issuers completely eliminate redemption risk? No. Issuers can mitigate but not erase redemption risk. Credit facilities and liquid staking tokens lower near-term exposure but introduce cost or basis risks that must be disclosed to investors. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Will Solana ETFs be easier to redeem than Ethereum ETFs?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Solana’s shorter unstaking periods can enable faster redemptions, reducing reliance on credit facilities, though issuer design and market stress will determine actual redemption speed.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How long are Ethereum exit queues currently?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Onchain data in early September showed entry peaks near 860,369 ETH and exit backlogs exceeding two million ETH, with average exit waits measured in weeks.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Can issuers completely eliminate redemption risk?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Issuers can mitigate but not eliminate redemption risk; options like credit facilities and liquid staking tokens reduce near-term exposure but add cost and other risks.\" } } ]} Key Takeaways Shorter unstaking helps : Solana’s faster unstaking can reduce ETF redemption delays and operational risk. Ethereum trade-offs : Ethereum offers scale and liquidity but faces longer exit queues that can strain ETF redemptions. Issuer mitigation : Credit facilities and liquid staking tokens are practical workarounds but carry costs and risks. Conclusion As the SEC weighs staking features for SOL and ETH ETFs in October, operational factors like unstaking periods are central to issuer planning. Solana’s shorter unstaking window presents a clear operational benefit for staking ETFs, while Ethereum-based products must address longer withdrawal queues through liquidity solutions. Market participants should monitor regulatory outcomes and onchain metrics closely.",

        "body": "Crypto charts in Q4 2025 are flashing like neon signs, and community members are chasing signals harder than ever. Bitcoin is holding key levels, Ethereum’s upgrade cycle is building anticipation, and meme tokens are leading a fresh round of viral rallies. Conversations are shifting from “what’s safe” to “what’s next,” and new meme coin projects are pulling attention away from the usual heavyweights. Every scroll through trading apps shows whales stacking, and participants debating whether to grab bags or stay sidelined. At the center of this growing buzz, MoonBull ($MOBU) is being called the boldest entry of the season. MoonBull ($MOBU) launched with mechanics designed to cut through the noise and deliver serious conviction. Alongside other projects like Dogecoin, which remains the meme market pioneer, and BullZilla, a beast that refuses to be ignored, these names are setting the pace for October’s meme run. With a unique structure, community-first tokenomics, and a rising tally in its presale, MoonBull is carving out its lane as the new upcoming crypto in 2025 that participants refuse to overlook. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU) Headlines the Meme Market With Strong Presale Surge MoonBull isn’t just a playful ticker; it’s a project engineered with scarcity and sustainability in mind. In its 4th presale stage, the token is priced at $0.00005168, already pulling in over $200,000 from more than 600 holders.

With the next stage marking a 27.40% increase, the design leaves little room for hesitation. Every stage is more than just a number, it’s an acceleration point built to reward conviction. The mechanics backing MoonBull ensure stability doesn’t just depend on market chatter. Through 2% liquidity injections, 2% passive reflections, and 1% permanent burns, the contract transforms selling pressure into fuel for the system.

Its staking program, kicking off with a massive 95% APY pool, makes holding more than just a bag—it makes it a growth machine. Tied to Ethereum’s secure ERC-20 base, and governed by its own community vote from Stage 12, MoonBull is positioning itself as the new upcoming crypto in 2025 that blends meme culture with formal mechanics like no other. 2.

In Q4 2025, trading activity remains consistent, driven by its presence across nearly every exchange and wallet. Dogecoin thrives on community-driven value, its memes still circulating as hard as its transactions. While the price doesn’t mirror the wild rallies of its early days, its stability and recognition keep it a trusted pick among community members who want a familiar coin with historic credibility.

The loyal Doge army has turned memes into markets, keeping Dogecoin firmly within the conversation. While new coins pop up daily, Dogecoin’s mix of longevity and relatability keeps it in the spotlight, proving that even the oldest meme projects can thrive when community belief refuses to die. 3. BullZilla Roars Into October as a Top Meme Coin to Buy Now BullZilla has gained traction by branding itself as the monster coin of 2025.

In Q4 2025, Shiba Inu is pushing updates around its Shibarium layer-2 solution, strengthening the coin’s utility and making it more than just a meme ticker. For community members, this signals long-term vision, where memes meet infrastructure. Its decentralized exchanges and staking pools keep liquidity flowing, ensuring Shiba Inu’s role isn’t sidelined by new projects. October finds Shiba Inu benefiting from renewed excitement in decentralized applications and cross-chain compatibility. The coin is leveraging its branding strength while offering serious tools for holders. Participants recognize that SHIB continues to balance meme culture with expanding utility, cementing its place as a project that stays relevant while many meme tokens burn out. 5. Pudgy Penguins March Into 2025 With Viral Momentum Pudgy Penguins has transformed from a quirky NFT collection into a cultural meme asset that carries real trading power. In 2025, it’s no longer just about cute artwork, but about a community-first token that thrives on cultural presence.

        "body": "Solana staking ETF: Solana’s much shorter unstaking window can reduce redemption delays, giving Solana-based staking ETFs a practical advantage over Ethereum products when issuers must return assets quickly during high demand. Shorter unstaking on Solana reduces redemption risk for staking ETFs. Ethereum’s long exit queue and recent spikes in pending withdrawals create potential liquidity and cost challenges for ETF issuers. Onchain data shows Ethereum’s exit queue measured in millions of ETH, increasing average exit times and pressure on fund redemptions. Solana staking ETF advantage: Solana’s faster unstaking can ease ETF redemptions ahead of October SEC decisions — read analysis and implications now. What gives Solana an edge over Ethereum for staking ETFs? Solana staking ETF proponents argue the network’s shorter unstaking period lowers redemptions risk, enabling issuers to return assets faster. That operational difference matters for ETFs that must meet redemption timelines and reduces reliance on costly liquidity solutions. How do unstaking periods affect ETF redemptions? Unstaking periods determine how quickly an issuer can convert staked assets back to liquid tokens for investor redemptions. Ethereum’s exit queue has grown substantially — early September saw an entry queue peak near 860,369 ETH, while exit backlogs exceeded two million ETH, producing average wait times measured in weeks. By contrast, Solana’s unstaking typically clears faster, lowering the probability of delayed redemptions and the need for expensive credit facilities or complex liquidity overlays. Onchain data and issuer statements highlight these operational differences as a major consideration for product design and investor protection. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Solana’s shorter unstaking window may give it an advantage over Ethereum for staking ETFs\", \"image\": [\"https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a0c5-8814-7f83-a167-1aff2a62caf5.webp\"], \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-01T08:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-01T08:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png\" } }, \"description\": \"Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley says Solana’s shorter unstaking period gives it an advantage over Ethereum in the staking ETF race as the SEC readies October rulings.\"} Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley says Solana’s shorter unstaking period gives it an advantage over Ethereum in the race for staking ETFs, as US regulators prepare key decisions in October. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said Solana may gain an edge over Ethereum in the staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, pointing to Solana’s design as more favorable for issuers who must meet tight redemption timelines. Speaking at Token2049 in Singapore, Horsley emphasized that Solana’s quicker unstaking window can materially reduce delays. He noted that Ethereum’s withdrawal queue recently reached new highs and that extended exit backlogs create meaningful operational challenges for ETF issuers. “It’s a huge problem,” Horsley said. “The ETFs need to be able to return assets on a very short time frame. So this is a huge challenge.” Staking requires locking tokens to secure a network and earn rewards. Locked assets face withdrawal timing constraints that vary by protocol and network demand. These constraints directly affect an ETF issuer’s ability to honor redemptions without maintaining large liquidity buffers. Horsley explained that Ethereum-based products can use alternatives — for example, credit facilities to fund redemptions or liquid staking tokens such as stETH — but those workarounds carry costs and capacity limits. He cited Bitwise’s European Ethereum staking ETP approach that uses a credit facility to preserve redemption liquidity as an example of necessary mitigation. Horsley’s remarks follow onchain metrics that tracked the Ethereum staking entry queue near 860,369 ETH in early September and showed the current ETH staking queue at 201,984 ETH with an average wait of about three days for entry. The exit queue has been longer, with figures indicating more than 2 million staked tokens awaiting withdrawal, translating into average exit times measured in weeks. When will the SEC decide on SOL and ETH ETFs? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is scheduled to make decisions on multiple pending Solana and Ethereum ETF filings in October. Several asset managers amended S-1 filings to include staking provisions as they prepare for regulatory review. Notable proposals referenced in filings include applications from Bitwise, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, CoinShares, Grayscale Investments, Canary Capital, and VanEck for Solana ETFs with staking features. The SEC delayed decisions on certain Ether staking approvals to late October; BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust staking approval was pushed to Oct. 30. Source: Nate Geraci Why do issuers consider credit facilities and liquid staking tokens? Issuers use credit facilities to bridge redemptions while staked assets remain illiquid, but these facilities increase cost and create capacity constraints. Liquid staking tokens — such as popular liquid derivatives in the market — offer another workaround by giving holders tradable claims on staked positions. Both approaches are practical but imperfect: credit facilities add financial overhead; liquid staking tokens can introduce basis and protocol risk. Regulators and issuers must weigh these trade-offs in product approvals and disclosures. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to assess unstaking risk for staking ETFs\", \"description\": \"A short procedure to evaluate protocol unstaking timelines and ETF redemption risk.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Check unstaking windows\", \"text\": \"Review the network’s documented unstaking and exit queue behavior and average wait times.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Examine onchain metrics\", \"text\": \"Use onchain data to measure current entry and exit queues, pending withdrawals, and recent spikes.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Evaluate liquidity overlays\", \"text\": \"Assess the issuer’s planned liquidity facilities, costs, and capacity constraints for redemptions.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Consider liquid staking alternatives\", \"text\": \"Determine the role and risks of liquid staking tokens or derivative products in the ETF structure.\" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Will Solana ETFs be easier to redeem than Ethereum ETFs? Typically yes: Solana’s shorter unstaking periods can enable faster redemptions, reducing reliance on credit facilities. However, product design, liquidity arrangements, and market stress scenarios will ultimately determine practical redemption speed. How long are Ethereum exit queues currently? Onchain data showed entry peaks near 860,369 ETH in early September, an active queue around 201,984 ETH for entry, and exit backlogs exceeding two million ETH, producing average exit waits of several weeks. Can issuers completely eliminate redemption risk? No. Issuers can mitigate but not erase redemption risk. Credit facilities and liquid staking tokens lower near-term exposure but introduce cost or basis risks that must be disclosed to investors. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Will Solana ETFs be easier to redeem than Ethereum ETFs?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Solana’s shorter unstaking periods can enable faster redemptions, reducing reliance on credit facilities, though issuer design and market stress will determine actual redemption speed.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How long are Ethereum exit queues currently?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Onchain data in early September showed entry peaks near 860,369 ETH and exit backlogs exceeding two million ETH, with average exit waits measured in weeks.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Can issuers completely eliminate redemption risk?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Issuers can mitigate but not eliminate redemption risk; options like credit facilities and liquid staking tokens reduce near-term exposure but add cost and other risks.\" } } ]} Key Takeaways Shorter unstaking helps : Solana’s faster unstaking can reduce ETF redemption delays and operational risk. Ethereum trade-offs : Ethereum offers scale and liquidity but faces longer exit queues that can strain ETF redemptions. Issuer mitigation : Credit facilities and liquid staking tokens are practical workarounds but carry costs and risks. Conclusion As the SEC weighs staking features for SOL and ETH ETFs in October, operational factors like unstaking periods are central to issuer planning. Solana’s shorter unstaking window presents a clear operational benefit for staking ETFs, while Ethereum-based products must address longer withdrawal queues through liquidity solutions. Market participants should monitor regulatory outcomes and onchain metrics closely.",

        "body": "Bitcoin extended its rally into October, breaking above $117,000 for the first time since mid-September as fresh U.S. labor market data boosted expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts. The world’s largest cryptocurrency jumped more than 4% on the day , decisively shattering the $115,000 resistance zone. The move came after the Automatic Data Processing (ADP), a U.S.-based payroll and HR management company, reported a surprise loss of 32,000 private payrolls in September , versus expectations for a gain of 45,000. It marked the third decline in the past four months , indicating clear signs of economic weakness.

BREAKING: THE ODDS OF AN OCTOBER RATE CUT IS NOW AT 100%. BULLISH FOR CRYPTO pic.twitter.com/inlk0YfRXD — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) October 1, 2025 A dovish Fed is widely viewed as a tailwind for Bitcoin, weakening the dollar and driving demand for risk assets. This aligns with Bitcoin’s historical seasonality. October, November, and December have consistently delivered strong returns, with “Uptober” often kicking off a year-end rally. Historical Patterns Align: Will Q4 Deliver Bitcoin’s Next Mega Rally? On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows Bitcoin entering Q4 with conditions supportive of a rally. By reclaiming the Trader’s Realized Price at $116K, Bitcoin has re-entered the bull phase of its cycle indicator. Source: CryptoQuant Spot Bitcoin demand has grown steadily since July, now running at a 62,000 BTC monthly growth rate. Such sustained demand was also present during Q4 rallies in 2020, 2021, and 2024. Whale holdings reinforce the bullish picture. Large Bitcoin addresses are expanding at an annual rate of 331,000 BTC, compared to 255,000 in Q4 2024, 238,000 at the start of Q4 2020, and a contraction of 197,000 in 2021. CryptoQuant estimates that these catalysts could expand Bitcoin’s potential Q4 target range toward $160,000–$200,000. From a high-timeframe perspective, Bitcoin’s structure aligns with Wyckoff accumulation theory and broader macro liquidity cycles. The monetary policy shift in January 2024 marked the beginning of an accumulation range, while the April 6 “spring” low provided the foundation for the current uptrend. #Bitcoin High Timeframe – Oct 1st Bitcoin follows Global Money Supply. pic.twitter.com/LQbscYP9Lx — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) October 1, 2025 Within this structure, levels at $106,400 and $125,600 are identified as automatic reaction and support zones, while upside projections between $150,000 and $185,000 are considered major targets in the first quarter of 2026. This suggests Bitcoin remains early in a larger bullish expansion phase , with pullbacks likely to serve as healthy corrections rather than the start of a deeper reversal. Technical Analysis: Bitcoin Support at $108K, Resistance at $120K, Eyes on $135K+ On the technical front, Bitcoin is consolidating near $117,000 with clearly defined thresholds for both bullish continuation and potential reversal. The key structural support sits near $108,131. Should price falls below this level, it would flip the outlook bearish. However, as long as Bitcoin holds above the $113,000 to $118,000 range, the broader trend remains favorable for the bulls. On the upside, immediate resistance lies at $120,000, a psychological barrier that, if broken, could open the path toward new all-time highs above $130,000. Should momentum persist, targets in the $122,000 to $125,000 range come into focus, with extension projections pointing as high as $145,000 to $150,000.

Technical Analysis: Strong Bullish Structure Above All EMAs XRP’s current price of $2.9543 reflects a robust +3.78% gain from the opening price of $2.8468 , establishing a volatile trading range between $2.9550 (high) and $2.8141 (low). This 4.8% intraday range demonstrates exceptional volatility typical of major institutional catalyst responses.

Market Context: Bank of Japan Integration Validates Institutional Utility XRP’s surge follows the Bank of Japan’s SBI announcement of an official XRP lending program , representing unprecedented institutional validation. Community analysis highlights “Bank of Japan (SBI) announces official $XRP lending program,” signaling “ Japan is preparing to utilize XRP for institutional payments at scale .” The Japanese institutional integration provides concrete utility validation beyond speculation, with XRP surpassing Bitcoin in trading volume on South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit, demonstrating accelerated Asian institutional demand. This geographic concentration suggests systematic regional adoption patterns. Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s transition to CTO Emeritus after 13 years marks a sign of institutional maturation rather than weakness. Community interpretation suggests “XRP is ready to run without him” as infrastructure development reaches the self-sustaining institutional adoption phase, requiring less founder dependency. Partnership expansion continues with Ondo Finance tokenizing U.S. treasuries on the XRP Ledger, while discussions on SWIFT integration persist despite recent Chainlink collaboration announcements.

There are 6 companies awaiting SEC decisions on $XRP ETFs starting from the 2nd week of October. pic.twitter.com/vXAEZwZHEY — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) September 30, 2025 Community sentiment emphasizes “ Uptober ” narrative with discussions of “ biggest month in XRP history ” as regulatory timeline convergence with technical positioning creates compelling setup. The 2017 pattern comparison gains traction with analysts noting “XRP bullish quarterly close above the resistance for the first time since 2017, ” suggesting historical parallel formation. The technical structure mirrors previous cycle accumulation patterns preceding major appreciation phases. Market Fundamentals: Exceptional Metrics Support Institutional Confidence XRP maintains substantial positioning with $175.35 billion market cap ( +3.49% ). The market cap growth accompanies increased volume at $6.48 billion ( +34.76% ), indicating active institutional repositioning. The 3.69% volume-to-market cap ratio suggests exceptional trading activity supporting price appreciation during catalyst events such as this. Source: CoinMarketCap Additionally, a market dominance of 4.41% ( -0.15% ) shows slight weakness relative to the broader market but maintains substantial altcoin leadership positioning. However, a fully diluted valuation of $293.71 billion reflects the total network value, including future releases, while the holder count of 476,250 shows both retail interest and institutional adoption. Social Sentiment: Institutional Confidence Amid Leadership Transition LunarCrush data reveals improving social performance with XRP’s AltRank at 253 ( +12 ) during institutional developments. Galaxy Score of 68 ( +23 ) reflects an exceptional sentiment surge as participants process Japanese banking integration and ETF timeline convergence. Engagement metrics show substantial increases with 20.07 million total engagements ( +1.44M ) and 65.3K mentions ( +27.66K ). Additionally, social dominance of 3.7% ( +1.5% ) shows exceptional growth, while sentiment registers at a robust 83% positive. Prominent analysts identify 2017 pattern similarities with some projecting “ $20 by December” targets while others emphasize near-term $3.15 breakout levels. Technical discussions center on quarterly close patterns and historical cycle comparisons, suggesting major appreciation potential. ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis: Institutional Infrastructure Meets Technical Breakout ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals XRP positioned for potential psychological $3.00 breakthrough following Japanese institutional program validation and leadership transition signs. Immediate resistance emerges at the psychological $3.00 level, followed by key resistance at $3.05 – $3.10 range. Breaking above these levels would signal institutional adoption validation, driving momentum toward $3.20 – $3.30 + targets based on previous resistance structures. Source: TradingView Support structure remains exceptional with 50-day EMA ( $2.9220 ) providing immediate downside protection, followed by layered support at 100-day ( $2.8386 ) and 200-day ( $2.6160 ) EMAs. The technical setup suggests bullish bias for catalyst-driven continuation with excellent risk-reward positioning. Three-Month XRP Price Forecast: ETF and Institutional Scenarios Institutional Breakthrough (55% Probability) Successful break above $3.00 combined with October ETF approvals could drive XRP toward $3.50 – $4.00 , representing 18 – 35% upside from current levels. Source: TradingView This scenario requires regulatory validation and Japanese program scaling confirmation. Consolidation Before Launch (30% Probability) Continued resistance testing could result in consolidation between $2.85 – $3.10 , allowing institutional program development while awaiting ETF decisions before the next major catalyst-driven move. Source: TradingView Correction Risk (15% Probability) Failure at $3.00 resistance could trigger selling toward $2.85 – $2.80 support levels, representing 3 – 6% downside. Source: TradingView Recovery would depend on ETF decision outcomes and Japanese program adoption metrics. ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis: Banking Integration Validates Payment Infrastructure ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals XRP at a key inflection point between Japanese institutional banking validation and psychological resistance breakthrough requirement. Next Price Target: $3.50-$4.00 Within 90 Days The immediate trajectory requires a decisive break above $3.00 psychological resistance to validate institutional banking integration momentum. From there, ETF approval acceleration could propel XRP toward $3.50 institutional target, with sustained Japanese program scaling driving toward $4.00 + breakout levels. However, failure to break $3.00 would indicate extended consolidation toward $2.85 – $2.90 range, creating a final accumulation opportunity before the next institutional wave drives XRP toward $5.00 + targets.

        "body": "VisionSys AI saw its shares plunge more than 57% on Wednesday after the company unveiled an ambitious plan to launch a $2 billion Solana (SOL) treasury program in partnership with staking provider Marinade Finance. The AI-powered healthcare and biotech solutions firm said its subsidiary, Medintel Technology, signed an exclusive partnership with Marinade to build one of the largest digital currency reserves among publicly traded companies. BREAKING: Nasdaq-listed VisionSys AI (VSA) has launched an up to $2B Solana treasury initiative in an exclusive partnership with @MarinadeFinance . The first phase targets $500M in $SOL to be acquired and staked within 6 months. pic.twitter.com/C7ei0iB4AX — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) October 1, 2025 The initiative, which begins with a $500 million acquisition and staking of SOL over the next six months, is intended to bolster VisionSys’s balance sheet, enhance liquidity, and deliver long-term shareholder value. Marinade Finance to Manage VisionSys’s Staking in $2B Solana Treasury Push Marinade Finance, Solana’s leading staking protocol, will manage the staking operations, ensuring compliance and performance optimization. The company has previously supported more than 154,000 SOL holders and undergone multiple security audits, giving VisionSys access to a well-established platform. Chief Executive Officer Heng Wang described the move as a transformational step for the company, combining VisionSys’s proprietary AI algorithms with Solana’s high-performance blockchain. “It positions VisionSys as a pioneer of AI-driven blockchain treasury management,” Wang said in the announcement. “By leveraging Marinade’s expertise, we are building a foundation for the future, exploring next-generation intelligent DeFi solutions and tokenomics models.” If successful, VisionSys’s treasury would rank among the five largest publicly traded Solana reserves, trailing Forward Industries, which currently holds $1.5 billion in SOL. Despite the announcement, investors reacted sharply. VSA shares closed at $2.05, down 40% on the day, after hitting an intraday low of $1.26. The selloff erased much of the company’s recent momentum, though the stock remains up more than 200% year-to-date. VisionSys’s market capitalization now stands at roughly $34.2 million. In contrast, Marinade’s governance token, MNDE, edged higher, gaining 2.3% to trade around $0.13, according to CoinGecko data. The company did not provide details on how it would finance the first $500 million phase of the treasury build-out, a point that analysts say could determine the feasibility of the program. The firm’s longer-term goal is to scale the treasury to $2 billion, a target that would place VisionSys alongside major corporate players in the digital asset sector. Nine Corporations Now Control 2.47% of Solana, Worth $2.9B A wave of corporate moves is placing Solana at the center of digital asset treasury strategies, with multiple firms announcing major financings and adoption plans in September. On September 15, Helius Medical Technologies revealed a $500 million private investment in public equity , led by Pantera Capital, to establish a Solana treasury. The deal, paired with $750 million in stapled warrants, could expand its war chest to $1.25 billion. Investors included Animoca Brands, Arrington Capital, HashKey Capital, and Republic Digital. Helius Medical raises $500M backed by Pantera Capital for $1.25B Solana treasury with stock surging 159% after announcement. #Solana #Treasury https://t.co/xG4c9AN0dF — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 15, 2025 Days later, Brera Holdings said it raised $300 million in a private placement to launch Solmate , a Solana-focused infrastructure and treasury arm. Backers included ARK Invest, the Solana Foundation, and UAE investors. The company plans dual listings on Nasdaq and the UAE exchange. Forward Industries has taken the strategy further. On September 11, it closed a $1.65 billion financing led by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital, acquiring 6.8 million SOL. The firm has also filed plans for a $4 billion equity program and has announced a partnership with Superstate to tokenize its stock on Solana , making FORD shares tradable on-chain.

DeFi Development Corp has expanded its buyback program to $100 million while continuing to grow its Solana holdings, now valued near $500 million. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-listed Upexi appointed Solana investor SOL Big Brain as an advisor , strengthening its position as the third-largest public Solana treasury with $421 million in holdings. According to CoinGecko’s Solana treasury reserve data , nine entities now hold 2.47% of Solana, valued at $2.9 billion. Together, these moves show Solana’s growing role as a reserve asset for public companies and institutions, positioning it at the forefront of efforts to integrate digital assets into mainstream corporate finance.

        "body": "Strategy no longer expects to owe a multi‑billion dollar corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on unrealized Bitcoin gains after the IRS and Treasury clarified that unrealized gains and losses on digital assets are excluded from CAMT calculations, removing a major potential tax overhang for the company. CAMT exclusion clarified Strategy will follow IRS/Treasury guidance and does not expect CAMT liability from unrealized Bitcoin gains in 2026 and beyond. Strategy’s Bitcoin unrealized gain is nearly $28 billion on $47.4 billion invested (current valuation cited in company filings). Strategy CAMT clarified: IRS/Treasury exclude unrealized digital-asset gains from CAMT calculations — learn what this means for corporate Bitcoin holders. Read on for details. What is the impact of the CAMT clarification on Strategy? Strategy CAMT clarification removes the need to include unrealized gains or losses on digital assets when determining liability for the 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT). Strategy now says it “no longer expects to become subject to CAMT due to unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings” for 2026 and beyond, per its SEC filing. How did the IRS and Treasury change CAMT guidance for digital assets? The IRS and Treasury issued a 71‑page guidance document stating firms are not required to factor unrealized gains or losses on digital assets into CAMT calculations. This clarification explicitly excludes mark‑to‑market changes on cryptocurrencies from the CAMT base for corporations. Tax and market analysts, including TD Cowen (analyst Lance Vitzanza), said the guidance removes a significant potential overhang on Strategy’s stock and avoided a possible multi‑billion cash tax liability that could have begun in 2026. Why does this matter for corporate Bitcoin holders? Front-loading the effect: companies holding large Bitcoin positions were at risk of an unexpected CAMT liability as crypto appreciated. With the clarification, unrealized appreciation will not automatically trigger CAMT, improving cash‑tax planning and reducing potential forced liquidations or capital redeployments tied to tax needs. How much unrealized gain does Strategy hold and what changed in market reaction? Strategy has spent approximately $47.4 billion acquiring Bitcoin and currently carries an unrealized gain close to $28 billion based on its filings. Following the IRS/Treasury guidance and Strategy’s confirmation, Strategy shares rose about 5% in intraday trading; the stock has advanced roughly 10% over the past six months. Strategy Bitcoin holdings — key figures Metric Reported Value Amount spent on Bitcoin $47.4 billion Current unrealized gain ~$28 billion Company-reported Bitcoin stockpile value $75 billion (approx.) Recent share movement Up ~5% on guidance; +10% past six months When did Strategy change its CAMT outlook and where was it disclosed? Strategy disclosed the change in outlook in an SEC filing following the IRS and Treasury guidance. The company previously indicated in June that it expected CAMT liabilities; after the guidance, Strategy stated it “no longer expects to become subject to CAMT due to unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings.” What did analysts and market data report? TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitzanza said the IRS action removed a significant potential overhang, noting Strategy could have faced substantial cash tax liabilities if unrealized gains were included. Market data providers and financial news commentary reported a short‑term positive market reaction. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Does the CAMT clarification apply to unrealized Bitcoin gains?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Yes.

This guidance sets a precedent: corporations holding digital assets should not include unrealized gains or losses in CAMT computations. Companies will continue reporting holdings per SEC and accounting standards and will reference the IRS/Treasury guidance for tax planning. Does this remove all tax risk associated with corporate crypto holdings? No. The clarification addresses CAMT treatment of unrealized gains. Corporations still face ordinary tax rules on realized gains, withholding regimes, state taxes, and evolving regulatory or legislative changes; firms should continue robust tax and compliance reviews. Key Takeaways Immediate relief : The IRS/Treasury clarified that unrealized digital‑asset gains are excluded from CAMT, easing potential tax pressure on large holders. Strategy outlook : Strategy stated it no longer expects CAMT liability from unrealized Bitcoin gains in 2026 and beyond, per its SEC filing. Next steps for firms : Corporations should update tax models, maintain disclosure transparency, and monitor official guidance and accounting interpretations. Conclusion The IRS and Treasury clarification materially reduces the near‑term tax uncertainty for Strategy and other corporate Bitcoin holders by excluding unrealized gains from CAMT calculations. Companies should incorporate the guidance into tax planning and public disclosures while continuing to monitor rulemaking and accounting guidance. COINOTAG will update this report if further official guidance or company disclosures emerge. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How corporate Bitcoin holders should respond to CAMT clarification\", \"description\": \"Steps for tax and finance teams to implement following IRS/Treasury guidance excluding unrealized digital-asset gains from CAMT.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/article/strategy-camt-clarification\", \"name\": \"Review official guidance\", \"text\": \"Obtain and review the IRS and Treasury guidance document to confirm the scope and effective dates.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/article/strategy-camt-clarification\", \"name\": \"Update tax models\", \"text\": \"Revise corporate CAMT projections and cash tax forecasts to remove unrealized digital‑asset gains from the CAMT base.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/article/strategy-camt-clarification\", \"name\": \"Disclose changes\", \"text\": \"Prepare public disclosures and investor communications reflecting updated tax positions and potential impacts on liquidity and capital allocation.\" } ], \"totalTime\": \"PT2H\"} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"mainEntityOfPage\": { \"@type\": \"WebPage\", \"@id\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/article/strategy-camt-clarification\" }, \"headline\": \"IRS/Treasury Clarify CAMT Treatment for Strategy’s Bitcoin Holdings\", \"description\": \"Strategy CAMT clarified: IRS and Treasury exclude unrealized digital-asset gains from CAMT calculations, easing potential multi-billion tax exposure for Strategy.\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png\" } }, \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-01T08:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-01T08:00:00Z\"} By COINOTAG — Published: 2025-10-01 — Updated: 2025-10-01",

        "body": "Stocks printed fresh records and gold is on a tear crossing $3,900, but the last leg higher in traditional markets left bitcoin (BTC) behind. The largest crypto, often touted as digital gold, has been stuck in a $100,000–$120,000 range for nearly three months after setting new highs in July and August. The lag fits a pattern. Over the past couple of years, gold and bitcoin have taken turns: when gold breaks out, bitcoin tends to consolidate; when gold cools, BTC often resumes the advance. From January into April, BTC plunged about 30% while gold kicked off its next leg, rising roughly 28% to $3,500 at the height of the global tariff tantrum. Gold then stalled into August, and bitcoin took the baton, rallying about 60% from trough to peak to notch fresh records. Bitcoin to catch up when gold tires \"Gold likes low rates and a weak economy, whereas bitcoin likes them firm,\" said Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree, in a recent report . \"Because bitcoin likes a super strong economy, and low rates are associated with economic slumps.\" He added that the BTC–gold relationship is loose: the 90-day correlation has averaged around 0.1 — \"basically zero.\" Right now, gold is in a lockout rally toward $4,000, up about 17% across a seven-week winning streak. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is still ranging below $120,000. If the recent rhythm holds, a pause in gold, or even a sideways drift, could be the tell for BTC’s next break out of the range and another run at records. \"The good news for bitcoin is that sooner or later, gold will get tired,\" Morris said.",

        "body": "Solana staking ETF: Solana’s much shorter unstaking window can reduce redemption delays, giving Solana-based staking ETFs a practical advantage over Ethereum products when issuers must return assets quickly during high demand. Shorter unstaking on Solana reduces redemption risk for staking ETFs. Ethereum’s long exit queue and recent spikes in pending withdrawals create potential liquidity and cost challenges for ETF issuers. Onchain data shows Ethereum’s exit queue measured in millions of ETH, increasing average exit times and pressure on fund redemptions. Solana staking ETF advantage: Solana’s faster unstaking can ease ETF redemptions ahead of October SEC decisions — read analysis and implications now. What gives Solana an edge over Ethereum for staking ETFs? Solana staking ETF proponents argue the network’s shorter unstaking period lowers redemptions risk, enabling issuers to return assets faster. That operational difference matters for ETFs that must meet redemption timelines and reduces reliance on costly liquidity solutions. How do unstaking periods affect ETF redemptions? Unstaking periods determine how quickly an issuer can convert staked assets back to liquid tokens for investor redemptions. Ethereum’s exit queue has grown substantially — early September saw an entry queue peak near 860,369 ETH, while exit backlogs exceeded two million ETH, producing average wait times measured in weeks. By contrast, Solana’s unstaking typically clears faster, lowering the probability of delayed redemptions and the need for expensive credit facilities or complex liquidity overlays. Onchain data and issuer statements highlight these operational differences as a major consideration for product design and investor protection. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"Solana’s shorter unstaking window may give it an advantage over Ethereum for staking ETFs\", \"image\": [\"https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199a0c5-8814-7f83-a167-1aff2a62caf5.webp\"], \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-01T08:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-01T08:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png\" } }, \"description\": \"Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley says Solana’s shorter unstaking period gives it an advantage over Ethereum in the staking ETF race as the SEC readies October rulings.\"} Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley says Solana’s shorter unstaking period gives it an advantage over Ethereum in the race for staking ETFs, as US regulators prepare key decisions in October. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said Solana may gain an edge over Ethereum in the staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, pointing to Solana’s design as more favorable for issuers who must meet tight redemption timelines. Speaking at Token2049 in Singapore, Horsley emphasized that Solana’s quicker unstaking window can materially reduce delays. He noted that Ethereum’s withdrawal queue recently reached new highs and that extended exit backlogs create meaningful operational challenges for ETF issuers. “It’s a huge problem,” Horsley said. “The ETFs need to be able to return assets on a very short time frame. So this is a huge challenge.” Staking requires locking tokens to secure a network and earn rewards. Locked assets face withdrawal timing constraints that vary by protocol and network demand. These constraints directly affect an ETF issuer’s ability to honor redemptions without maintaining large liquidity buffers. Horsley explained that Ethereum-based products can use alternatives — for example, credit facilities to fund redemptions or liquid staking tokens such as stETH — but those workarounds carry costs and capacity limits. He cited Bitwise’s European Ethereum staking ETP approach that uses a credit facility to preserve redemption liquidity as an example of necessary mitigation. Horsley’s remarks follow onchain metrics that tracked the Ethereum staking entry queue near 860,369 ETH in early September and showed the current ETH staking queue at 201,984 ETH with an average wait of about three days for entry. The exit queue has been longer, with figures indicating more than 2 million staked tokens awaiting withdrawal, translating into average exit times measured in weeks. When will the SEC decide on SOL and ETH ETFs? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is scheduled to make decisions on multiple pending Solana and Ethereum ETF filings in October. Several asset managers amended S-1 filings to include staking provisions as they prepare for regulatory review. Notable proposals referenced in filings include applications from Bitwise, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, CoinShares, Grayscale Investments, Canary Capital, and VanEck for Solana ETFs with staking features. The SEC delayed decisions on certain Ether staking approvals to late October; BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust staking approval was pushed to Oct. 30. Source: Nate Geraci Why do issuers consider credit facilities and liquid staking tokens? Issuers use credit facilities to bridge redemptions while staked assets remain illiquid, but these facilities increase cost and create capacity constraints. Liquid staking tokens — such as popular liquid derivatives in the market — offer another workaround by giving holders tradable claims on staked positions. Both approaches are practical but imperfect: credit facilities add financial overhead; liquid staking tokens can introduce basis and protocol risk. Regulators and issuers must weigh these trade-offs in product approvals and disclosures. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to assess unstaking risk for staking ETFs\", \"description\": \"A short procedure to evaluate protocol unstaking timelines and ETF redemption risk.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Check unstaking windows\", \"text\": \"Review the network’s documented unstaking and exit queue behavior and average wait times.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Examine onchain metrics\", \"text\": \"Use onchain data to measure current entry and exit queues, pending withdrawals, and recent spikes.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Evaluate liquidity overlays\", \"text\": \"Assess the issuer’s planned liquidity facilities, costs, and capacity constraints for redemptions.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Consider liquid staking alternatives\", \"text\": \"Determine the role and risks of liquid staking tokens or derivative products in the ETF structure.\" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Will Solana ETFs be easier to redeem than Ethereum ETFs? Typically yes: Solana’s shorter unstaking periods can enable faster redemptions, reducing reliance on credit facilities. However, product design, liquidity arrangements, and market stress scenarios will ultimately determine practical redemption speed. How long are Ethereum exit queues currently? Onchain data showed entry peaks near 860,369 ETH in early September, an active queue around 201,984 ETH for entry, and exit backlogs exceeding two million ETH, producing average exit waits of several weeks. Can issuers completely eliminate redemption risk? No. Issuers can mitigate but not erase redemption risk. Credit facilities and liquid staking tokens lower near-term exposure but introduce cost or basis risks that must be disclosed to investors. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Will Solana ETFs be easier to redeem than Ethereum ETFs?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Solana’s shorter unstaking periods can enable faster redemptions, reducing reliance on credit facilities, though issuer design and market stress will determine actual redemption speed.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How long are Ethereum exit queues currently?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Onchain data in early September showed entry peaks near 860,369 ETH and exit backlogs exceeding two million ETH, with average exit waits measured in weeks.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Can issuers completely eliminate redemption risk?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Issuers can mitigate but not eliminate redemption risk; options like credit facilities and liquid staking tokens reduce near-term exposure but add cost and other risks.\" } } ]} Key Takeaways Shorter unstaking helps : Solana’s faster unstaking can reduce ETF redemption delays and operational risk. Ethereum trade-offs : Ethereum offers scale and liquidity but faces longer exit queues that can strain ETF redemptions. Issuer mitigation : Credit facilities and liquid staking tokens are practical workarounds but carry costs and risks. Conclusion As the SEC weighs staking features for SOL and ETH ETFs in October, operational factors like unstaking periods are central to issuer planning. Solana’s shorter unstaking window presents a clear operational benefit for staking ETFs, while Ethereum-based products must address longer withdrawal queues through liquidity solutions. Market participants should monitor regulatory outcomes and onchain metrics closely.",

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-musk-worlds-first-500-billion-man/",
        "body": "Elon Musk officially became the first person in history to hit a $500 billion net worth on Wednesday, beating out every other billionaire alive. The number was confirmed at 3:30 p.m. Eastern by Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaires tracker, making Elon $150 billion richer than Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who now sits in second place after temporarily beating the ‘DogeFather’ just a few weeks ago, as Cryptopolitan reported . This record comes less than a year after Elon passed the $400 billion line in December, making this a new all-time high for personal wealth, and putting him halfway toward becoming the world’s first trillionaire. This happened after Tesla’s stock surged by nearly 4% the same day. That one-day surge added about $9.3 billion to Elon’s fortune. Back in April, Elon told investors on Tesla’s earnings call that he would step down from his government position under President Donald Trump to refocus on Tesla. He had been serving as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Since then, Tesla stock has nearly doubled in value, bringing the company’s total market cap to within 10% of its highest-ever valuation. As of now, Elon’s 12% stake in Tesla is valued at $191 billion, and it doesn’t even include the massive performance-based stock options package from 2018, which would be worth another $133 billion today, but sadly, a Delaware judge voided the award last year. Elon has appealed the decision to the Delaware Supreme Court, though, and while the case plays out, Forbes is discounting that part of his wealth by 50%. Tesla board proposes $1 trillion pay package amid court appeal While the 2018 stock grant remains stuck in legal limbo, Tesla’s board of directors introduced a new pay plan for Elon in September. This proposed package could give him stock worth up to $1 trillion, before taxes and share unlocking costs, if Tesla reaches extreme growth milestones. The plan includes a target for Tesla to multiply its market cap more than eight times over the next ten years. “It’s not about ‘compensation’, but about me having enough influence over Tesla to ensure safety if we build millions of robots,” Elon said on X. “If I can just get kicked out in the future by activist shareholder advisory firms who don’t even own Tesla shares themselves, I’m not comfortable with that future.” But Tesla alone isn’t what made the $500 billion number possible. Elon also owns a huge share of SpaceX, the rocket company he started in 2002. In August, SpaceX’s private valuation surged to $400 billion, up from $350 billion in December after a new tender offer. Elon holds 42% of SpaceX, and that stake is now worth $168 billion according to Forbes at press time. On top of that, there’s xAI Holdings, Elon’s AI startup that he merged with X (formerly Twitter). The combined entity is valued at $113 billion, and Elon owns 53%, which equals $60 billion more in his pocket. Elon was worth $24.6 billion just five years ago, in March 2020, but by August of that same year, Tesla’s stock rally had made him the fifth person to hit $100 billion. In January 2021, Elon became the world’s rich list after reaching $190 billion, then he became the third person to cross $200 billion in September 2021, after Jeff Bezos and Bernard Arnault. Then came $300 billion in November, and finally $400 billion in December 2024. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter. It's free .",

        "body": "Crypto charts in Q4 2025 are flashing like neon signs, and community members are chasing signals harder than ever. Bitcoin is holding key levels, Ethereum’s upgrade cycle is building anticipation, and meme tokens are leading a fresh round of viral rallies. Conversations are shifting from “what’s safe” to “what’s next,” and new meme coin projects are pulling attention away from the usual heavyweights. Every scroll through trading apps shows whales stacking, and participants debating whether to grab bags or stay sidelined. At the center of this growing buzz, MoonBull ($MOBU) is being called the boldest entry of the season. MoonBull ($MOBU) launched with mechanics designed to cut through the noise and deliver serious conviction. Alongside other projects like Dogecoin, which remains the meme market pioneer, and BullZilla, a beast that refuses to be ignored, these names are setting the pace for October’s meme run. With a unique structure, community-first tokenomics, and a rising tally in its presale, MoonBull is carving out its lane as the new upcoming crypto in 2025 that participants refuse to overlook. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU) Headlines the Meme Market With Strong Presale Surge MoonBull isn’t just a playful ticker; it’s a project engineered with scarcity and sustainability in mind. In its 4th presale stage, the token is priced at $0.00005168, already pulling in over $200,000 from more than 600 holders. For early buyers, the ROI from stage entry to its projected listing price of $0.00616 already exceeds 11,800%, while those who joined from the earliest stages secured a 106% gain. With the next stage marking a 27.40% increase, the design leaves little room for hesitation. Every stage is more than just a number, it’s an acceleration point built to reward conviction. The mechanics backing MoonBull ensure stability doesn’t just depend on market chatter. Through 2% liquidity injections, 2% passive reflections, and 1% permanent burns, the contract transforms selling pressure into fuel for the system. Community members aren’t simply waiting for pumps; they’re rewarded every step of the way. Its staking program, kicking off with a massive 95% APY pool, makes holding more than just a bag—it makes it a growth machine. Tied to Ethereum’s secure ERC-20 base, and governed by its own community vote from Stage 12, MoonBull is positioning itself as the new upcoming crypto in 2025 that blends meme culture with formal mechanics like no other. 2. Dogecoin Holds Its Meme Crown in Q4 2025 Dogecoin continues to stand as the face of meme coins, a name that refuses to fade even when new entrants flood the market. In Q4 2025, trading activity remains consistent, driven by its presence across nearly every exchange and wallet. Dogecoin thrives on community-driven value, its memes still circulating as hard as its transactions. While the price doesn’t mirror the wild rallies of its early days, its stability and recognition keep it a trusted pick among community members who want a familiar coin with historic credibility. October sees Dogecoin leaning further into mainstream integration, with merchant adoption campaigns making headlines again. The loyal Doge army has turned memes into markets, keeping Dogecoin firmly within the conversation. While new coins pop up daily, Dogecoin’s mix of longevity and relatability keeps it in the spotlight, proving that even the oldest meme projects can thrive when community belief refuses to die. 3. BullZilla Roars Into October as a Top Meme Coin to Buy Now BullZilla has gained traction by branding itself as the monster coin of 2025. Its design merges humor with power, positioning it as a meme coin that refuses to stay in the shadows. In October, BullZilla’s narrative has been fueled by rising mentions across online communities, particularly among those chasing fresh meme picks. The project thrives on virality, tapping into larger-than-life branding that makes it hard to ignore in a crowd of smaller tokens. Beyond the memes, BullZilla has leaned into strong liquidity injections and gamified community incentives. By rewarding active holders with access to limited events and unique engagement bonuses, it builds an identity that stretches beyond trading charts. As one of the top meme coins to buy now , BullZilla carries the meme market energy of 2021 into 2025, proving that fresh branding and consistent community backing can turn a playful name into a coin worth watching. 4. Shiba Inu Pushes Forward With Ecosystem Expansion Shiba Inu has been more than just Dogecoin’s rival; it’s been building its own sprawling ecosystem. In Q4 2025, Shiba Inu is pushing updates around its Shibarium layer-2 solution, strengthening the coin’s utility and making it more than just a meme ticker. For community members, this signals long-term vision, where memes meet infrastructure. Its decentralized exchanges and staking pools keep liquidity flowing, ensuring Shiba Inu’s role isn’t sidelined by new projects. October finds Shiba Inu benefiting from renewed excitement in decentralized applications and cross-chain compatibility. The coin is leveraging its branding strength while offering serious tools for holders. Participants recognize that SHIB continues to balance meme culture with expanding utility, cementing its place as a project that stays relevant while many meme tokens burn out. 5. Pudgy Penguins March Into 2025 With Viral Momentum Pudgy Penguins has transformed from a quirky NFT collection into a cultural meme asset that carries real trading power. In 2025, it’s no longer just about cute artwork, but about a community-first token that thrives on cultural presence. October showcases Pudgy Penguins with new partnerships and global merchandise drops, reinforcing its branding both on-chain and off-chain. This evolution has kept it trending in markets where meme value and real-world recognition collide. Community enthusiasm fuels Pudgy Penguins’ strength. From viral Twitter campaigns to consistent secondary market activity, this project holds staying power that new entrants often fail to replicate. As 2025 unfolds, Pudgy Penguins proves that meme-driven tokens backed by strong identity and consistent innovation can command real attention, blending viral traction with long-term cultural positioning. Conclusion: Is MoonBull ($MOBU) the New Upcoming Crypto in 2025? The projects highlighted for October—MoonBull, Dogecoin, BullZilla, Shiba Inu, and Pudgy Penguins—represent the mix of heritage, virality, and structured presale strength that defines Q4 2025. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to hold strong through history and ecosystem growth. BullZilla and Pudgy Penguins bring energy through community branding and cultural expansion. Yet MoonBull’s mechanics, from reflections to burns, from staking to governance, create a design that directly rewards those who step in early. With its presale already in Stage 4, MoonBull stands as a rarity among meme tokens, offering structured scarcity alongside cultural power. Participants chasing presale hype tokens with limited supply are recognizing that this isn’t just another ticker; it’s a community-first system engineered for sustainability. MoonBull’s early access rewards and smart mechanics ensure it doesn’t just ride a trend—it builds one. For those seeking the next meme coin boom in 2025, the MoonBull presale is shaping up as the definitive entry.

        "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-forms-golden-cross/",
        "body": "The Dogecoin price is about to complete a Golden Cross pattern, a technical event that often signals the start of a super bullish run. A crypto analyst argues that the real test lies at $0.33, a resistance level that could determine whether DOGE begins its next major rally and extends its momentum into the broader altcoin market. Golden Cross Forms On Dogecoin Price Chart Crypto analyst Cas Abbe recently highlighted in an X social media post Dogecoin’s bullish momentum, noting that the meme coin is about to complete another Golden Cross. In technical terms, a Golden Cross signals the potential start of an extended bullish cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Skirts Potential Demand Zone, What Happens If It Hits Right? Cas Abbe emphasized the significance of this chart setup, pointing out that every time Dogecoin rallies, the broader altcoin market tends to follow suit. According to him, if DOGE manages to break decisively above key resistance levels, it could trigger a massive bullish surge, marking the beginning of a strong altcoin season. The analyst’s chart illustrates Dogecoin’s upward trajectory, with the price steadily climbing after bouncing from support levels around $0.21. His projection shows the meme coin advancing toward the upper resistance channel, where $0.33 sits as the key battleground. Cas Abbe predicts that a breakout beyond this threshold would push the Dogecoin price to $0.37, representing a roughly 60% surge from current levels around $0.23. Adding to the bullish narrative, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade also shared his perspective on Dogecoin’s Golden Cross formation. He focused on the 12-hour chart, where the MACD indicator flashes the bullish chart signal. According to him, the histogram has already turned green, a clear sign of rising buying pressure. Additionally, Trader Tardigrade’s analysis suggests that bulls are beginning to take control of the market, with his chart predicting a potential surge toward the $0.32 – $0.33 zone. Expert Says Dogecoin To Reach $1 Next A crypto market expert identified as ‘Solid’ on X has drawn attention to a broader structure forming on Dogecoin’s weekly chart. His analysis reveals a broad consolidation area that could serve as the foundation for a parabolic rally. Based on this technical formation, Solid has forecasted that a golden bull run is imminent—one that could propel the DOGE price to the $1 milestone in the long term. This would reflect a massive price increase of approximately 334%. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts Dogecoin Price To See Face-Melting Rally: The Bullish Pattern That Suggests New Highs In the chart, Dogecoin’s current price action started as part of a larger consolidation phase that began after the 2021 peak. Now with bullish momentum starting to resurface after months of suppression, Solid’s analysis suggests that a strong upward breakout is becoming increasingly likely. The curved trajectory drawn on his chart envisions the meme coin riding steadily through 2025, ultimately accelerating past previous resistance levels and entering uncharted territory around $1 by 2026.

        "body": "The official US government shutdown has disrupted the launch of dozens of altcoin ETFs. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s final approval process for cryptocurrency ETFs has been thrown into uncertainty with the government shutdown. The SEC was reportedly considering applications for ETFs based on various altcoins, including DOGE, XRP, and LTC. Numerous companies have submitted these applications over the past year, amid the Trump administration's more conservative approach to crypto. However, Congress' failure to reach a budget agreement on Tuesday night stalled the process. A source familiar with the matter said, “Under normal circumstances, it's safe to say the SEC ceases operations during lockdowns. There's a small possibility that SEC Chairman Paul Atkins might grant a special exemption to crypto ETFs, but that's not certain.” The SEC is not currently expected to take action to register or list new ETFs, meaning any comment letters or approval processes for applications will be suspended until the government reopens. Related News: One of Japan's Largest Financial Companies May Have Had Its Cryptocurrency Wallets Hacked - Here Are the Details Tomorrow, in particular, is a critical deadline for the Canary Litecoin ETF. However, these dates have lost their significance due to regulatory changes made by the SEC last month. The commission accepted listing standards proposed by three exchanges, allowing crypto ETFs to trade more quickly without the need for the 19b-4 process. Once the government opens up, the process could be “nearly automatic,” according to the sources. If ETF applications meet general listing standards, SEC approval could be faster than for past spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Some experts suggest that the SEC could approve individual product ETFs en masse, which could happen in October or November. However, the most critical factor here is when the registration documents will become effective. This process is entirely dependent on the decision of the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance. “As with the Solana ETF process, when applications are submitted on the same day, the institution evaluates them collectively. However, applications submitted on different days may be approached differently,” the source said, adding that there will be a heavy application traffic in the coming weeks. *This is not investment advice.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency jumped more than 4% on the day , decisively shattering the $115,000 resistance zone. The move came after the Automatic Data Processing (ADP), a U.S.-based payroll and HR management company, reported a surprise loss of 32,000 private payrolls in September , versus expectations for a gain of 45,000. It marked the third decline in the past four months , indicating clear signs of economic weakness.

BREAKING: THE ODDS OF AN OCTOBER RATE CUT IS NOW AT 100%. BULLISH FOR CRYPTO pic.twitter.com/inlk0YfRXD — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) October 1, 2025 A dovish Fed is widely viewed as a tailwind for Bitcoin, weakening the dollar and driving demand for risk assets. This aligns with Bitcoin’s historical seasonality. October, November, and December have consistently delivered strong returns, with “Uptober” often kicking off a year-end rally. Historical Patterns Align: Will Q4 Deliver Bitcoin’s Next Mega Rally? On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows Bitcoin entering Q4 with conditions supportive of a rally. By reclaiming the Trader’s Realized Price at $116K, Bitcoin has re-entered the bull phase of its cycle indicator. Source: CryptoQuant Spot Bitcoin demand has grown steadily since July, now running at a 62,000 BTC monthly growth rate. Such sustained demand was also present during Q4 rallies in 2020, 2021, and 2024. Whale holdings reinforce the bullish picture. Large Bitcoin addresses are expanding at an annual rate of 331,000 BTC, compared to 255,000 in Q4 2024, 238,000 at the start of Q4 2020, and a contraction of 197,000 in 2021. CryptoQuant estimates that these catalysts could expand Bitcoin’s potential Q4 target range toward $160,000–$200,000. From a high-timeframe perspective, Bitcoin’s structure aligns with Wyckoff accumulation theory and broader macro liquidity cycles. The monetary policy shift in January 2024 marked the beginning of an accumulation range, while the April 6 “spring” low provided the foundation for the current uptrend. #Bitcoin High Timeframe – Oct 1st Bitcoin follows Global Money Supply. pic.twitter.com/LQbscYP9Lx — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) October 1, 2025 Within this structure, levels at $106,400 and $125,600 are identified as automatic reaction and support zones, while upside projections between $150,000 and $185,000 are considered major targets in the first quarter of 2026. This suggests Bitcoin remains early in a larger bullish expansion phase , with pullbacks likely to serve as healthy corrections rather than the start of a deeper reversal. Technical Analysis: Bitcoin Support at $108K, Resistance at $120K, Eyes on $135K+ On the technical front, Bitcoin is consolidating near $117,000 with clearly defined thresholds for both bullish continuation and potential reversal. The key structural support sits near $108,131. Should price falls below this level, it would flip the outlook bearish. However, as long as Bitcoin holds above the $113,000 to $118,000 range, the broader trend remains favorable for the bulls. On the upside, immediate resistance lies at $120,000, a psychological barrier that, if broken, could open the path toward new all-time highs above $130,000. Should momentum persist, targets in the $122,000 to $125,000 range come into focus, with extension projections pointing as high as $145,000 to $150,000.

At the same time, XRP shows exceptional technical strength, trading above all major EMAs, including the 20-day ( $2.5049 ), 50-day ( $2.9220 ), 100-day ( $2.8386 ), and 200-day ( $2.6160 ) support levels, positioning it for a potential $3.00 + breakthrough amid the October ETF decision timeline. ChatGPT’s XRP analysis synthesizes 23 + real-time technical indicators to assess XRP’s trajectory, while testing psychological $3.00 resistance with multiple ETF decisions pending. Technical Analysis: Strong Bullish Structure Above All EMAs XRP’s current price of $2.9543 reflects a robust +3.78% gain from the opening price of $2.8468 , establishing a volatile trading range between $2.9550 (high) and $2.8141 (low). This 4.8% intraday range demonstrates exceptional volatility typical of major institutional catalyst responses. Source: TradingView The RSI at 52.52 maintains neutral positioning, providing substantial room for upside continuation without overbought conditions. Moving averages reveal exceptional bullish positioning with XRP trading above all EMAs: 20-day at $2.5049 ( -15.2% ), 50-day at $2.9220 ( -1.1% ), 100-day at $2.8386 ( -3.9% ), and 200-day at $2.6160 ( -11.5% ). MACD also shows slight bearish positioning at -0.0012 just below zero with the signal line at -0.0266 , but a negative histogram at -0.0254 indicates improving momentum divergence. Source: TradingView Similarly, volume analysis shows exceptional activity at 97.71 million XRP, indicating massive institutional participation during the Bank of Japan announcement and CTO transition processing. The ATR maintains high readings at 2.5709 , suggesting continued volatility potential for moves toward psychological resistance levels. Market Context: Bank of Japan Integration Validates Institutional Utility XRP’s surge follows the Bank of Japan’s SBI announcement of an official XRP lending program , representing unprecedented institutional validation. Community analysis highlights “Bank of Japan (SBI) announces official $XRP lending program,” signaling “ Japan is preparing to utilize XRP for institutional payments at scale .” The Japanese institutional integration provides concrete utility validation beyond speculation, with XRP surpassing Bitcoin in trading volume on South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit, demonstrating accelerated Asian institutional demand. This geographic concentration suggests systematic regional adoption patterns. Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s transition to CTO Emeritus after 13 years marks a sign of institutional maturation rather than weakness. Community interpretation suggests “XRP is ready to run without him” as infrastructure development reaches the self-sustaining institutional adoption phase, requiring less founder dependency. Partnership expansion continues with Ondo Finance tokenizing U.S. treasuries on the XRP Ledger, while discussions on SWIFT integration persist despite recent Chainlink collaboration announcements. Horrendous week to be an $XRP holder. First, SWIFT announces that it's working with @chainlink and @Consensys on a blockchain-based ledger. Now, @Ripple 's CTO just quit earlier today.

The 2017 pattern comparison gains traction with analysts noting “XRP bullish quarterly close above the resistance for the first time since 2017, ” suggesting historical parallel formation. The technical structure mirrors previous cycle accumulation patterns preceding major appreciation phases. Market Fundamentals: Exceptional Metrics Support Institutional Confidence XRP maintains substantial positioning with $175.35 billion market cap ( +3.49% ). The market cap growth accompanies increased volume at $6.48 billion ( +34.76% ), indicating active institutional repositioning. The 3.69% volume-to-market cap ratio suggests exceptional trading activity supporting price appreciation during catalyst events such as this. Source: CoinMarketCap Additionally, a market dominance of 4.41% ( -0.15% ) shows slight weakness relative to the broader market but maintains substantial altcoin leadership positioning. However, a fully diluted valuation of $293.71 billion reflects the total network value, including future releases, while the holder count of 476,250 shows both retail interest and institutional adoption. Social Sentiment: Institutional Confidence Amid Leadership Transition LunarCrush data reveals improving social performance with XRP’s AltRank at 253 ( +12 ) during institutional developments. Galaxy Score of 68 ( +23 ) reflects an exceptional sentiment surge as participants process Japanese banking integration and ETF timeline convergence. Engagement metrics show substantial increases with 20.07 million total engagements ( +1.44M ) and 65.3K mentions ( +27.66K ). Additionally, social dominance of 3.7% ( +1.5% ) shows exceptional growth, while sentiment registers at a robust 83% positive. Prominent analysts identify 2017 pattern similarities with some projecting “ $20 by December” targets while others emphasize near-term $3.15 breakout levels. Technical discussions center on quarterly close patterns and historical cycle comparisons, suggesting major appreciation potential. ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis: Institutional Infrastructure Meets Technical Breakout ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals XRP positioned for potential psychological $3.00 breakthrough following Japanese institutional program validation and leadership transition signs. Immediate resistance emerges at the psychological $3.00 level, followed by key resistance at $3.05 – $3.10 range. Breaking above these levels would signal institutional adoption validation, driving momentum toward $3.20 – $3.30 + targets based on previous resistance structures.

The technical setup suggests bullish bias for catalyst-driven continuation with excellent risk-reward positioning. Three-Month XRP Price Forecast: ETF and Institutional Scenarios Institutional Breakthrough (55% Probability) Successful break above $3.00 combined with October ETF approvals could drive XRP toward $3.50 – $4.00 , representing 18 – 35% upside from current levels.

ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis: Banking Integration Validates Payment Infrastructure ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals XRP at a key inflection point between Japanese institutional banking validation and psychological resistance breakthrough requirement. Next Price Target: $3.50-$4.00 Within 90 Days The immediate trajectory requires a decisive break above $3.00 psychological resistance to validate institutional banking integration momentum. From there, ETF approval acceleration could propel XRP toward $3.50 institutional target, with sustained Japanese program scaling driving toward $4.00 + breakout levels. However, failure to break $3.00 would indicate extended consolidation toward $2.85 – $2.90 range, creating a final accumulation opportunity before the next institutional wave drives XRP toward $5.00 + targets.

        "body": "The official US government shutdown has disrupted the launch of dozens of altcoin ETFs. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s final approval process for cryptocurrency ETFs has been thrown into uncertainty with the government shutdown. The SEC was reportedly considering applications for ETFs based on various altcoins, including DOGE, XRP, and LTC. Numerous companies have submitted these applications over the past year, amid the Trump administration's more conservative approach to crypto. However, Congress' failure to reach a budget agreement on Tuesday night stalled the process. A source familiar with the matter said, “Under normal circumstances, it's safe to say the SEC ceases operations during lockdowns. There's a small possibility that SEC Chairman Paul Atkins might grant a special exemption to crypto ETFs, but that's not certain.” The SEC is not currently expected to take action to register or list new ETFs, meaning any comment letters or approval processes for applications will be suspended until the government reopens. Related News: One of Japan's Largest Financial Companies May Have Had Its Cryptocurrency Wallets Hacked - Here Are the Details Tomorrow, in particular, is a critical deadline for the Canary Litecoin ETF. However, these dates have lost their significance due to regulatory changes made by the SEC last month. The commission accepted listing standards proposed by three exchanges, allowing crypto ETFs to trade more quickly without the need for the 19b-4 process. Once the government opens up, the process could be “nearly automatic,” according to the sources. If ETF applications meet general listing standards, SEC approval could be faster than for past spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Some experts suggest that the SEC could approve individual product ETFs en masse, which could happen in October or November. However, the most critical factor here is when the registration documents will become effective. This process is entirely dependent on the decision of the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance. “As with the Solana ETF process, when applications are submitted on the same day, the institution evaluates them collectively. However, applications submitted on different days may be approached differently,” the source said, adding that there will be a heavy application traffic in the coming weeks. *This is not investment advice.

        "body": "Strategy no longer expects to owe a multi‑billion dollar corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on unrealized Bitcoin gains after the IRS and Treasury clarified that unrealized gains and losses on digital assets are excluded from CAMT calculations, removing a major potential tax overhang for the company. CAMT exclusion clarified Strategy will follow IRS/Treasury guidance and does not expect CAMT liability from unrealized Bitcoin gains in 2026 and beyond. Strategy’s Bitcoin unrealized gain is nearly $28 billion on $47.4 billion invested (current valuation cited in company filings). Strategy CAMT clarified: IRS/Treasury exclude unrealized digital-asset gains from CAMT calculations — learn what this means for corporate Bitcoin holders. Read on for details. What is the impact of the CAMT clarification on Strategy? Strategy CAMT clarification removes the need to include unrealized gains or losses on digital assets when determining liability for the 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT). Strategy now says it “no longer expects to become subject to CAMT due to unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings” for 2026 and beyond, per its SEC filing. How did the IRS and Treasury change CAMT guidance for digital assets? The IRS and Treasury issued a 71‑page guidance document stating firms are not required to factor unrealized gains or losses on digital assets into CAMT calculations. This clarification explicitly excludes mark‑to‑market changes on cryptocurrencies from the CAMT base for corporations. Tax and market analysts, including TD Cowen (analyst Lance Vitzanza), said the guidance removes a significant potential overhang on Strategy’s stock and avoided a possible multi‑billion cash tax liability that could have begun in 2026. Why does this matter for corporate Bitcoin holders? Front-loading the effect: companies holding large Bitcoin positions were at risk of an unexpected CAMT liability as crypto appreciated. With the clarification, unrealized appreciation will not automatically trigger CAMT, improving cash‑tax planning and reducing potential forced liquidations or capital redeployments tied to tax needs. How much unrealized gain does Strategy hold and what changed in market reaction? Strategy has spent approximately $47.4 billion acquiring Bitcoin and currently carries an unrealized gain close to $28 billion based on its filings. Following the IRS/Treasury guidance and Strategy’s confirmation, Strategy shares rose about 5% in intraday trading; the stock has advanced roughly 10% over the past six months. Strategy Bitcoin holdings — key figures Metric Reported Value Amount spent on Bitcoin $47.4 billion Current unrealized gain ~$28 billion Company-reported Bitcoin stockpile value $75 billion (approx.) Recent share movement Up ~5% on guidance; +10% past six months When did Strategy change its CAMT outlook and where was it disclosed? Strategy disclosed the change in outlook in an SEC filing following the IRS and Treasury guidance. The company previously indicated in June that it expected CAMT liabilities; after the guidance, Strategy stated it “no longer expects to become subject to CAMT due to unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings.” What did analysts and market data report? TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitzanza said the IRS action removed a significant potential overhang, noting Strategy could have faced substantial cash tax liabilities if unrealized gains were included. Market data providers and financial news commentary reported a short‑term positive market reaction. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Does the CAMT clarification apply to unrealized Bitcoin gains?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Yes. The IRS and Treasury guidance states that firms do not need to include unrealized gains or losses on digital assets when determining CAMT liability.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Will Strategy owe CAMT from its Bitcoin holdings in 2026?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Strategy announced it no longer expects to become subject to CAMT due to unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings in 2026 and beyond, based on the IRS/Treasury clarification.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How large is Strategy’s unrealized gain on Bitcoin?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Company filings report Strategy spent $47.4 billion on Bitcoin and holds an unrealized gain of about $28 billion as of its latest disclosures.\" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Will this IRS guidance change how other corporations report Bitcoin? This guidance sets a precedent: corporations holding digital assets should not include unrealized gains or losses in CAMT computations. Companies will continue reporting holdings per SEC and accounting standards and will reference the IRS/Treasury guidance for tax planning. Does this remove all tax risk associated with corporate crypto holdings? No. The clarification addresses CAMT treatment of unrealized gains. Corporations still face ordinary tax rules on realized gains, withholding regimes, state taxes, and evolving regulatory or legislative changes; firms should continue robust tax and compliance reviews. Key Takeaways Immediate relief : The IRS/Treasury clarified that unrealized digital‑asset gains are excluded from CAMT, easing potential tax pressure on large holders. Strategy outlook : Strategy stated it no longer expects CAMT liability from unrealized Bitcoin gains in 2026 and beyond, per its SEC filing. Next steps for firms : Corporations should update tax models, maintain disclosure transparency, and monitor official guidance and accounting interpretations. Conclusion The IRS and Treasury clarification materially reduces the near‑term tax uncertainty for Strategy and other corporate Bitcoin holders by excluding unrealized gains from CAMT calculations. Companies should incorporate the guidance into tax planning and public disclosures while continuing to monitor rulemaking and accounting guidance.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-falls-below-210-as-investors-turn-to-mutuum-finance-mutm-for-q4-profits/",
        "body": "Solana (SOL) has dropped below the critical $210 level this week, with profit-taking and volatility within the wider market exacting a toll on investor sentiment. While SOL’s fundamentals remain strong, many traders are now turning to other alternatives with better near-term growth potential, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as a front-runner. Prevalently priced at just $0.035 in its stage 6 presale, Mutuum Finance is building one of the most ambitious decentralized finance ecosystems of 2025, with peer-to-peer and pooled lending, without sacrificing asset custody. The stage is already over 50% sold out. The project’s novelty has already attracted more than 16,670 holders and more than $16.6 million worth of presale investments, a testament to growing confidence among crypto whales as well as retail investors alike. With both high-upside tokenomics and early-stage momentum along with real-world utility, analysts believe that MUTM could report much stronger Q4 returns compared to industry titans like Solana. Solana Tests Crucial Support, Can Bulls Regain Control Before Year-End Solana (SOL) trades at around $202.48, testing a critical rising trendline that can determine its next move. Having both the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages is offering support, with the primary Fibonacci retracement levels between $214 and $223 determining short-term momentum. A decisive breakout above the range could pave the way for upside objectives at $253, $274, $301, and even $331, representing a strong bullish follow-through to Q4. However, failure to hold current levels and breakdown below $175 could accelerate losses towards $158 or $140, further constricting pressure on market sentiment. As traders gaze upon these key levels, investors already have their eyes on new prospects with better near-term upside, and that’s progressively turning heads to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Hits New Heights Mutuum Finance is dominating the DeFi space with its presale, garnering over 16,670 investors and raising over $16.6 million up to now. The presale has progressed to Phase 6 and is 50% through, with the MUTM tokens costing $0.035 apiece. As a token of gratitude to its initial supporters, the team has also initiated a $100,000 giveaway , distributing 10 winners $10,000 of MUTM tokens each. At the forefront of decentralized finance innovation, Mutuum Finance leverages Chainlink oracles to enable safe exchange, lending, and settlement for USD-backed tokens, as well as extremely liquid tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform ensures robust data integrity with multiple defense layers, including fallback oracle guards, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages, providing accurate and reliable price data even with brutal market conditions. Mutuum Finance also introduces a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that fall apart in bear markets, the token is overcollateralized and non-algorithmic, designed to provide price stability even during market downturns. The platform possesses a risk-adjusted Loan-to-Value (LTV) mechanism where each asset has an associated collateral ceiling attuned to its risk profile. This maintains lending in balance and at bay. In addition to the security of users during periods of volatility, the protocol features a buffer reserve mechanism where riskier assets are assigned increased reserves as additional collateral and to cover the ecosystem. With its record-breaking presale, innovative risk management, and commitment to transparency, Mutuum Finance is solidifying its reputation as a secure, robust, and visionary DeFi platform. Why Whales Are Switching to MUTM Instead of SOL Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to become one of the hottest DeFi projects of 2025, raising over $16.6 million from more than 16,670 investors and 50% through its Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per token. While Solana (SOL) journeys through volatility below $210, MUTM’s peer-to-peer lending and collective lending platform, USD-backed stablecoin, and sound risk management system are attracting serious attention from both retail and whales. Those seeking high-upside utility-focused crypto plays must lock in MUTM tokens prior to the presale event being complete. Join now.

        "body": "Crypto charts in Q4 2025 are flashing like neon signs, and community members are chasing signals harder than ever. Bitcoin is holding key levels, Ethereum’s upgrade cycle is building anticipation, and meme tokens are leading a fresh round of viral rallies. Conversations are shifting from “what’s safe” to “what’s next,” and new meme coin projects are pulling attention away from the usual heavyweights. Every scroll through trading apps shows whales stacking, and participants debating whether to grab bags or stay sidelined. At the center of this growing buzz, MoonBull ($MOBU) is being called the boldest entry of the season. MoonBull ($MOBU) launched with mechanics designed to cut through the noise and deliver serious conviction. Alongside other projects like Dogecoin, which remains the meme market pioneer, and BullZilla, a beast that refuses to be ignored, these names are setting the pace for October’s meme run. With a unique structure, community-first tokenomics, and a rising tally in its presale, MoonBull is carving out its lane as the new upcoming crypto in 2025 that participants refuse to overlook. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU) Headlines the Meme Market With Strong Presale Surge MoonBull isn’t just a playful ticker; it’s a project engineered with scarcity and sustainability in mind. In its 4th presale stage, the token is priced at $0.00005168, already pulling in over $200,000 from more than 600 holders. For early buyers, the ROI from stage entry to its projected listing price of $0.00616 already exceeds 11,800%, while those who joined from the earliest stages secured a 106% gain. With the next stage marking a 27.40% increase, the design leaves little room for hesitation. Every stage is more than just a number, it’s an acceleration point built to reward conviction. The mechanics backing MoonBull ensure stability doesn’t just depend on market chatter. Through 2% liquidity injections, 2% passive reflections, and 1% permanent burns, the contract transforms selling pressure into fuel for the system.

In Q4 2025, trading activity remains consistent, driven by its presence across nearly every exchange and wallet. Dogecoin thrives on community-driven value, its memes still circulating as hard as its transactions. While the price doesn’t mirror the wild rallies of its early days, its stability and recognition keep it a trusted pick among community members who want a familiar coin with historic credibility.

While new coins pop up daily, Dogecoin’s mix of longevity and relatability keeps it in the spotlight, proving that even the oldest meme projects can thrive when community belief refuses to die. 3. BullZilla Roars Into October as a Top Meme Coin to Buy Now BullZilla has gained traction by branding itself as the monster coin of 2025.

Shiba Inu Pushes Forward With Ecosystem Expansion Shiba Inu has been more than just Dogecoin’s rival; it’s been building its own sprawling ecosystem. In Q4 2025, Shiba Inu is pushing updates around its Shibarium layer-2 solution, strengthening the coin’s utility and making it more than just a meme ticker. For community members, this signals long-term vision, where memes meet infrastructure. Its decentralized exchanges and staking pools keep liquidity flowing, ensuring Shiba Inu’s role isn’t sidelined by new projects. October finds Shiba Inu benefiting from renewed excitement in decentralized applications and cross-chain compatibility. The coin is leveraging its branding strength while offering serious tools for holders. Participants recognize that SHIB continues to balance meme culture with expanding utility, cementing its place as a project that stays relevant while many meme tokens burn out. 5. Pudgy Penguins March Into 2025 With Viral Momentum Pudgy Penguins has transformed from a quirky NFT collection into a cultural meme asset that carries real trading power. In 2025, it’s no longer just about cute artwork, but about a community-first token that thrives on cultural presence. October showcases Pudgy Penguins with new partnerships and global merchandise drops, reinforcing its branding both on-chain and off-chain. This evolution has kept it trending in markets where meme value and real-world recognition collide. Community enthusiasm fuels Pudgy Penguins’ strength.

        "body": "The UK seized Bitcoin from 2018—approximately 61,000 BTC—remains subject to civil recovery proceedings; the government seeks to retain most funds while victims can claim compensation under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, with outcomes hinging on proprietary tracing and High Court rulings. Key point 1 — 61,000 BTC seized in 2018, linked to a Chinese investment fraud The Crown Prosecution Service has opened civil recovery in the High Court; a hearing is scheduled for January. Legal routes include pari passu distribution, equitable tracing, or fiat-value compensation (Robb v The National Crime Agency precedent). UK seized Bitcoin: 61,000 BTC from a 2018 fraud is in High Court civil recovery; learn how victims may claim compensation — read more now. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"UK seeks to retain most of the Bitcoin seized in 2018 fraud; victims to pursue civil recovery\", \"description\": \"The UK seized Bitcoin (61,000 BTC) in 2018 linked to a Chinese investment fraud.

UK seized Bitcoin is currently held under civil recovery proceedings after convictions tied to a Chinese investment fraud; the High Court will decide whether victims receive proprietary claims to BTC or compensation in fiat, and whether the U.K. state retains any surplus following legal distribution rules. How can victims claim compensation for the seized Bitcoin? Victims can apply under Section 281 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to make proprietary claims to frozen assets. Courts will apply equitable tracing and flexible trust principles to establish entitlement. Legal precedent such as Robb v The National Crime Agency guides proportional distributions (pari passu) and valuation methods. Who are the key parties and what are the stakes? The Crown Prosecution Service is pursuing civil recovery. Defendants include Zhimin Qian (recent guilty plea) and earlier-convicted assistant Seng Hok Ling. Rough figures: around 61,000 BTC seized, over 120,000 alleged victims, and reported losses near £640 million. The potential market value swing means distribution method critically affects outcomes. How might the High Court distribute the frozen Bitcoin? Courts may adopt one of three practical approaches: pari passu proportional distribution, compensation in fiat at time-of-loss values, or permitting the state to retain surplus value. Each approach has legal and fairness implications for claimants and for public finance considerations. Comparison of potential distribution outcomes Approach What victims receive Impact on state Pari passu Proportional BTC or equivalent value based on each investor’s share State role limited to administering distribution Fiat valuation Compensation equal to amount lost in GBP State may retain appreciation in BTC value State retention Victims may receive limited or no recovery State gains from market appreciation When is the next legal step in the case? The Crown Prosecution Service has initiated proceedings and the High Court will hear the next stage in January. Civil litigation could continue into 2027 depending on tracing complexity and the number of claimants. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How victims can pursue claims on seized Bitcoin\", \"description\": \"Step-by-step guide to submitting a civil recovery claim for frozen Bitcoin held by the UK.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Collect evidence\", \"text\": \"Gather records of payments, account details, and communications proving investment and loss.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Submit claim under Proceeds of Crime Act\", \"text\": \"File an application under Section 281 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to register a claim on frozen property.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Seek legal representation\", \"text\": \"Engage solicitors experienced in asset tracing and civil recovery to present proprietary or equitable tracing arguments.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Attend hearings\", \"text\": \"Participate in High Court civil recovery hearings and any distribution determinations.\" } ]} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Can the UK government legally keep seized Bitcoin?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"The UK government has initiated civil recovery but retention is not guaranteed; courts may award victims proprietary claims or fiat compensation under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 depending on tracing and precedent.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How much Bitcoin was seized in 2018?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Approximately 61,000 BTC was seized in connection with an investment fraud linked to Zhimin Qian and associates.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"What legal precedent affects distribution?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Robb v The National Crime Agency and equitable tracing principles inform proportional distribution (pari passu) and valuation choices in civil recovery cases.\" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Can victims recover Bitcoin or only fiat compensation? Victims may recover proprietary interests in BTC if they can trace funds to the seized assets. Courts sometimes award compensation in GBP equal to losses instead, which can leave the state with appreciation in BTC value. What legal tools are victims using to claim recovery? Claimants use Section 281 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, equitable tracing, and trust law arguments. London-based law firms represent many victims and coordinate cross-jurisdictional claims. Key Takeaways Seized amount: ~61,000 BTC taken in 2018 tied to an investment fraud. Legal path: Civil recovery in the High Court will determine rightful recipients under established tracing and distribution principles. Impact: Distribution method (pari passu vs fiat valuation) will decide if victims receive market gains or only original losses. Conclusion The dispute over the UK seized Bitcoin centers on competing legal principles: victims’ proprietary claims versus the state’s civil recovery prerogative. Upcoming High Court hearings and established case law will shape whether victims regain BTC value or receive fiat compensation. Monitor the January hearing and prepare documentation if you are a claimant.",

        "body": "According to Bloomberg, Tether, the world's largest stablecoin issuer, will collaborate with video platform Rumble to launch its newly developed dollar-backed digital asset, USAT, in the United States. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced plans to increase Rumble's market share in the US by targeting its 51 million monthly active users. Rumble will integrate a new crypto wallet into its YouTube-competitive platform, offering users access to USAT and other stablecoins. Tether acquired a 48% stake in Rumble with a $775 million investment in 2024. “Rumble's current user base is higher than many of our competitors in the US. This presents a huge opportunity for rapid growth for the company,” Ardoino said. Tether's biggest competitor in the US stablecoin market is USDC, issued by Circle. President Donald Trump's administration has created a legal framework for privately issued dollar-backed stablecoins with the Genius Act. Years ago, Tether withdrew from the US after allegedly making misleading statements about its reserves, paying a $41 million fine. However, this time, the company is spearheading its new US campaign under the leadership of former White House crypto advisor Bo Hines. Related News: Daha Önceki ABD Hükümet Kapanmalarında Bitcoin (BTC) Fiyatı Nasıl Tepki Vermişti? İşte Mutlaka Bilinmesi Gerekenler El Salvador-based Tether generates substantial income by holding its reserves in cash-like assets like U.S. Treasury bonds. The company reported $4.9 billion in profit in the second quarter of 2024. With these proceeds, it continues to invest in various sectors, including artificial intelligence, energy, and commodities. Ardoino argued that the Rumble partnership would be a strategic hub not only for USAT but also for Tether's tokenized gold product. Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski said in a statement, “Rumble represents freedom of expression; Tether's cryptocurrencies and the decentralized internet also represent true freedom. Rumble Wallet will be a product that combines these principles.” *This is not investment advice.

At the same time, XRP shows exceptional technical strength, trading above all major EMAs, including the 20-day ( $2.5049 ), 50-day ( $2.9220 ), 100-day ( $2.8386 ), and 200-day ( $2.6160 ) support levels, positioning it for a potential $3.00 + breakthrough amid the October ETF decision timeline. ChatGPT’s XRP analysis synthesizes 23 + real-time technical indicators to assess XRP’s trajectory, while testing psychological $3.00 resistance with multiple ETF decisions pending. Technical Analysis: Strong Bullish Structure Above All EMAs XRP’s current price of $2.9543 reflects a robust +3.78% gain from the opening price of $2.8468 , establishing a volatile trading range between $2.9550 (high) and $2.8141 (low). This 4.8% intraday range demonstrates exceptional volatility typical of major institutional catalyst responses. Source: TradingView The RSI at 52.52 maintains neutral positioning, providing substantial room for upside continuation without overbought conditions. Moving averages reveal exceptional bullish positioning with XRP trading above all EMAs: 20-day at $2.5049 ( -15.2% ), 50-day at $2.9220 ( -1.1% ), 100-day at $2.8386 ( -3.9% ), and 200-day at $2.6160 ( -11.5% ). MACD also shows slight bearish positioning at -0.0012 just below zero with the signal line at -0.0266 , but a negative histogram at -0.0254 indicates improving momentum divergence. Source: TradingView Similarly, volume analysis shows exceptional activity at 97.71 million XRP, indicating massive institutional participation during the Bank of Japan announcement and CTO transition processing. The ATR maintains high readings at 2.5709 , suggesting continued volatility potential for moves toward psychological resistance levels. Market Context: Bank of Japan Integration Validates Institutional Utility XRP’s surge follows the Bank of Japan’s SBI announcement of an official XRP lending program , representing unprecedented institutional validation. Community analysis highlights “Bank of Japan (SBI) announces official $XRP lending program,” signaling “ Japan is preparing to utilize XRP for institutional payments at scale .” The Japanese institutional integration provides concrete utility validation beyond speculation, with XRP surpassing Bitcoin in trading volume on South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit, demonstrating accelerated Asian institutional demand. This geographic concentration suggests systematic regional adoption patterns. Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s transition to CTO Emeritus after 13 years marks a sign of institutional maturation rather than weakness. Community interpretation suggests “XRP is ready to run without him” as infrastructure development reaches the self-sustaining institutional adoption phase, requiring less founder dependency. Partnership expansion continues with Ondo Finance tokenizing U.S. treasuries on the XRP Ledger, while discussions on SWIFT integration persist despite recent Chainlink collaboration announcements. Horrendous week to be an $XRP holder. First, SWIFT announces that it's working with @chainlink and @Consensys on a blockchain-based ledger. Now, @Ripple 's CTO just quit earlier today.

There are 6 companies awaiting SEC decisions on $XRP ETFs starting from the 2nd week of October. pic.twitter.com/vXAEZwZHEY — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) September 30, 2025 Community sentiment emphasizes “ Uptober ” narrative with discussions of “ biggest month in XRP history ” as regulatory timeline convergence with technical positioning creates compelling setup. The 2017 pattern comparison gains traction with analysts noting “XRP bullish quarterly close above the resistance for the first time since 2017, ” suggesting historical parallel formation. The technical structure mirrors previous cycle accumulation patterns preceding major appreciation phases. Market Fundamentals: Exceptional Metrics Support Institutional Confidence XRP maintains substantial positioning with $175.35 billion market cap ( +3.49% ). The market cap growth accompanies increased volume at $6.48 billion ( +34.76% ), indicating active institutional repositioning. The 3.69% volume-to-market cap ratio suggests exceptional trading activity supporting price appreciation during catalyst events such as this. Source: CoinMarketCap Additionally, a market dominance of 4.41% ( -0.15% ) shows slight weakness relative to the broader market but maintains substantial altcoin leadership positioning. However, a fully diluted valuation of $293.71 billion reflects the total network value, including future releases, while the holder count of 476,250 shows both retail interest and institutional adoption. Social Sentiment: Institutional Confidence Amid Leadership Transition LunarCrush data reveals improving social performance with XRP’s AltRank at 253 ( +12 ) during institutional developments. Galaxy Score of 68 ( +23 ) reflects an exceptional sentiment surge as participants process Japanese banking integration and ETF timeline convergence. Engagement metrics show substantial increases with 20.07 million total engagements ( +1.44M ) and 65.3K mentions ( +27.66K ). Additionally, social dominance of 3.7% ( +1.5% ) shows exceptional growth, while sentiment registers at a robust 83% positive. Prominent analysts identify 2017 pattern similarities with some projecting “ $20 by December” targets while others emphasize near-term $3.15 breakout levels. Technical discussions center on quarterly close patterns and historical cycle comparisons, suggesting major appreciation potential. ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis: Institutional Infrastructure Meets Technical Breakout ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals XRP positioned for potential psychological $3.00 breakthrough following Japanese institutional program validation and leadership transition signs. Immediate resistance emerges at the psychological $3.00 level, followed by key resistance at $3.05 – $3.10 range. Breaking above these levels would signal institutional adoption validation, driving momentum toward $3.20 – $3.30 + targets based on previous resistance structures. Source: TradingView Support structure remains exceptional with 50-day EMA ( $2.9220 ) providing immediate downside protection, followed by layered support at 100-day ( $2.8386 ) and 200-day ( $2.6160 ) EMAs. The technical setup suggests bullish bias for catalyst-driven continuation with excellent risk-reward positioning. Three-Month XRP Price Forecast: ETF and Institutional Scenarios Institutional Breakthrough (55% Probability) Successful break above $3.00 combined with October ETF approvals could drive XRP toward $3.50 – $4.00 , representing 18 – 35% upside from current levels. Source: TradingView This scenario requires regulatory validation and Japanese program scaling confirmation. Consolidation Before Launch (30% Probability) Continued resistance testing could result in consolidation between $2.85 – $3.10 , allowing institutional program development while awaiting ETF decisions before the next major catalyst-driven move. Source: TradingView Correction Risk (15% Probability) Failure at $3.00 resistance could trigger selling toward $2.85 – $2.80 support levels, representing 3 – 6% downside. Source: TradingView Recovery would depend on ETF decision outcomes and Japanese program adoption metrics. ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis: Banking Integration Validates Payment Infrastructure ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals XRP at a key inflection point between Japanese institutional banking validation and psychological resistance breakthrough requirement. Next Price Target: $3.50-$4.00 Within 90 Days The immediate trajectory requires a decisive break above $3.00 psychological resistance to validate institutional banking integration momentum. From there, ETF approval acceleration could propel XRP toward $3.50 institutional target, with sustained Japanese program scaling driving toward $4.00 + breakout levels. However, failure to break $3.00 would indicate extended consolidation toward $2.85 – $2.90 range, creating a final accumulation opportunity before the next institutional wave drives XRP toward $5.00 + targets.

        "body": "Strategy no longer expects to owe a multi‑billion dollar corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on unrealized Bitcoin gains after the IRS and Treasury clarified that unrealized gains and losses on digital assets are excluded from CAMT calculations, removing a major potential tax overhang for the company. CAMT exclusion clarified Strategy will follow IRS/Treasury guidance and does not expect CAMT liability from unrealized Bitcoin gains in 2026 and beyond. Strategy’s Bitcoin unrealized gain is nearly $28 billion on $47.4 billion invested (current valuation cited in company filings). Strategy CAMT clarified: IRS/Treasury exclude unrealized digital-asset gains from CAMT calculations — learn what this means for corporate Bitcoin holders. Read on for details. What is the impact of the CAMT clarification on Strategy? Strategy CAMT clarification removes the need to include unrealized gains or losses on digital assets when determining liability for the 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT). Strategy now says it “no longer expects to become subject to CAMT due to unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings” for 2026 and beyond, per its SEC filing. How did the IRS and Treasury change CAMT guidance for digital assets? The IRS and Treasury issued a 71‑page guidance document stating firms are not required to factor unrealized gains or losses on digital assets into CAMT calculations. This clarification explicitly excludes mark‑to‑market changes on cryptocurrencies from the CAMT base for corporations. Tax and market analysts, including TD Cowen (analyst Lance Vitzanza), said the guidance removes a significant potential overhang on Strategy’s stock and avoided a possible multi‑billion cash tax liability that could have begun in 2026. Why does this matter for corporate Bitcoin holders? Front-loading the effect: companies holding large Bitcoin positions were at risk of an unexpected CAMT liability as crypto appreciated. With the clarification, unrealized appreciation will not automatically trigger CAMT, improving cash‑tax planning and reducing potential forced liquidations or capital redeployments tied to tax needs. How much unrealized gain does Strategy hold and what changed in market reaction? Strategy has spent approximately $47.4 billion acquiring Bitcoin and currently carries an unrealized gain close to $28 billion based on its filings. Following the IRS/Treasury guidance and Strategy’s confirmation, Strategy shares rose about 5% in intraday trading; the stock has advanced roughly 10% over the past six months. Strategy Bitcoin holdings — key figures Metric Reported Value Amount spent on Bitcoin $47.4 billion Current unrealized gain ~$28 billion Company-reported Bitcoin stockpile value $75 billion (approx.) Recent share movement Up ~5% on guidance; +10% past six months When did Strategy change its CAMT outlook and where was it disclosed? Strategy disclosed the change in outlook in an SEC filing following the IRS and Treasury guidance. The company previously indicated in June that it expected CAMT liabilities; after the guidance, Strategy stated it “no longer expects to become subject to CAMT due to unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings.” What did analysts and market data report? TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitzanza said the IRS action removed a significant potential overhang, noting Strategy could have faced substantial cash tax liabilities if unrealized gains were included. Market data providers and financial news commentary reported a short‑term positive market reaction. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Does the CAMT clarification apply to unrealized Bitcoin gains?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Yes.

This guidance sets a precedent: corporations holding digital assets should not include unrealized gains or losses in CAMT computations. Companies will continue reporting holdings per SEC and accounting standards and will reference the IRS/Treasury guidance for tax planning. Does this remove all tax risk associated with corporate crypto holdings? No. The clarification addresses CAMT treatment of unrealized gains. Corporations still face ordinary tax rules on realized gains, withholding regimes, state taxes, and evolving regulatory or legislative changes; firms should continue robust tax and compliance reviews. Key Takeaways Immediate relief : The IRS/Treasury clarified that unrealized digital‑asset gains are excluded from CAMT, easing potential tax pressure on large holders. Strategy outlook : Strategy stated it no longer expects CAMT liability from unrealized Bitcoin gains in 2026 and beyond, per its SEC filing. Next steps for firms : Corporations should update tax models, maintain disclosure transparency, and monitor official guidance and accounting interpretations. Conclusion The IRS and Treasury clarification materially reduces the near‑term tax uncertainty for Strategy and other corporate Bitcoin holders by excluding unrealized gains from CAMT calculations. Companies should incorporate the guidance into tax planning and public disclosures while continuing to monitor rulemaking and accounting guidance.

        "body": "The new cryptocurrency project Plasma (XPL) has responded to the allegations circulating on social media in recent days. Rumors surrounding the XPL token suggested that the team was “made up of former Blast employees,” that “Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino invested only $50,000,” and that “the team sold 800 million tokens.” Plasma founder Paulie Punt denied these allegations one by one in his statement: No token sale: Punt stated that no team member sold XPL, all investor and team tokens are locked for 3 years, and there is a cliff for the first year. Team history: Punt said there are approximately 50 people on the Plasma team, but explained that only three of them previously worked at Blur or Blast. He also argued that the team comes from companies like Google, Facebook, Square, Temasek, Goldman Sachs, and Nuvei, adding, “If we were to describe our team as 'ex-Blast,' we should equally call it 'ex-Google' or 'ex-Goldman Sachs.'” No connection to Wintermute: Punt stated that they have never worked with Wintermute and have never engaged in any market-making activities. He added that they have the same information about Wintermute's holdings on the XPL as the public.

        "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-forms-golden-cross/",
        "body": "The Dogecoin price is about to complete a Golden Cross pattern, a technical event that often signals the start of a super bullish run. A crypto analyst argues that the real test lies at $0.33, a resistance level that could determine whether DOGE begins its next major rally and extends its momentum into the broader altcoin market. Golden Cross Forms On Dogecoin Price Chart Crypto analyst Cas Abbe recently highlighted in an X social media post Dogecoin’s bullish momentum, noting that the meme coin is about to complete another Golden Cross. In technical terms, a Golden Cross signals the potential start of an extended bullish cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Skirts Potential Demand Zone, What Happens If It Hits Right? Cas Abbe emphasized the significance of this chart setup, pointing out that every time Dogecoin rallies, the broader altcoin market tends to follow suit. According to him, if DOGE manages to break decisively above key resistance levels, it could trigger a massive bullish surge, marking the beginning of a strong altcoin season. The analyst’s chart illustrates Dogecoin’s upward trajectory, with the price steadily climbing after bouncing from support levels around $0.21. His projection shows the meme coin advancing toward the upper resistance channel, where $0.33 sits as the key battleground. Cas Abbe predicts that a breakout beyond this threshold would push the Dogecoin price to $0.37, representing a roughly 60% surge from current levels around $0.23. Adding to the bullish narrative, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade also shared his perspective on Dogecoin’s Golden Cross formation. He focused on the 12-hour chart, where the MACD indicator flashes the bullish chart signal. According to him, the histogram has already turned green, a clear sign of rising buying pressure. Additionally, Trader Tardigrade’s analysis suggests that bulls are beginning to take control of the market, with his chart predicting a potential surge toward the $0.32 – $0.33 zone. Expert Says Dogecoin To Reach $1 Next A crypto market expert identified as ‘Solid’ on X has drawn attention to a broader structure forming on Dogecoin’s weekly chart. His analysis reveals a broad consolidation area that could serve as the foundation for a parabolic rally. Based on this technical formation, Solid has forecasted that a golden bull run is imminent—one that could propel the DOGE price to the $1 milestone in the long term. This would reflect a massive price increase of approximately 334%. Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts Dogecoin Price To See Face-Melting Rally: The Bullish Pattern That Suggests New Highs In the chart, Dogecoin’s current price action started as part of a larger consolidation phase that began after the 2021 peak. Now with bullish momentum starting to resurface after months of suppression, Solid’s analysis suggests that a strong upward breakout is becoming increasingly likely. The curved trajectory drawn on his chart envisions the meme coin riding steadily through 2025, ultimately accelerating past previous resistance levels and entering uncharted territory around $1 by 2026.

        "body": "ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals XRP surging +3.78% to $2.9543 with strong bullish momentum as the Bank of Japan’s SBI announces an official XRP lending program for institutional payments, while Ripple CTO David Schwartz announces his exit from the company . At the same time, XRP shows exceptional technical strength, trading above all major EMAs, including the 20-day ( $2.5049 ), 50-day ( $2.9220 ), 100-day ( $2.8386 ), and 200-day ( $2.6160 ) support levels, positioning it for a potential $3.00 + breakthrough amid the October ETF decision timeline. ChatGPT’s XRP analysis synthesizes 23 + real-time technical indicators to assess XRP’s trajectory, while testing psychological $3.00 resistance with multiple ETF decisions pending. Technical Analysis: Strong Bullish Structure Above All EMAs XRP’s current price of $2.9543 reflects a robust +3.78% gain from the opening price of $2.8468 , establishing a volatile trading range between $2.9550 (high) and $2.8141 (low). This 4.8% intraday range demonstrates exceptional volatility typical of major institutional catalyst responses. Source: TradingView The RSI at 52.52 maintains neutral positioning, providing substantial room for upside continuation without overbought conditions. Moving averages reveal exceptional bullish positioning with XRP trading above all EMAs: 20-day at $2.5049 ( -15.2% ), 50-day at $2.9220 ( -1.1% ), 100-day at $2.8386 ( -3.9% ), and 200-day at $2.6160 ( -11.5% ). MACD also shows slight bearish positioning at -0.0012 just below zero with the signal line at -0.0266 , but a negative histogram at -0.0254 indicates improving momentum divergence. Source: TradingView Similarly, volume analysis shows exceptional activity at 97.71 million XRP, indicating massive institutional participation during the Bank of Japan announcement and CTO transition processing. The ATR maintains high readings at 2.5709 , suggesting continued volatility potential for moves toward psychological resistance levels. Market Context: Bank of Japan Integration Validates Institutional Utility XRP’s surge follows the Bank of Japan’s SBI announcement of an official XRP lending program , representing unprecedented institutional validation. Community analysis highlights “Bank of Japan (SBI) announces official $XRP lending program,” signaling “ Japan is preparing to utilize XRP for institutional payments at scale .” The Japanese institutional integration provides concrete utility validation beyond speculation, with XRP surpassing Bitcoin in trading volume on South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit, demonstrating accelerated Asian institutional demand. This geographic concentration suggests systematic regional adoption patterns. Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s transition to CTO Emeritus after 13 years marks a sign of institutional maturation rather than weakness. Community interpretation suggests “XRP is ready to run without him” as infrastructure development reaches the self-sustaining institutional adoption phase, requiring less founder dependency. Partnership expansion continues with Ondo Finance tokenizing U.S. treasuries on the XRP Ledger, while discussions on SWIFT integration persist despite recent Chainlink collaboration announcements. Horrendous week to be an $XRP holder. First, SWIFT announces that it's working with @chainlink and @Consensys on a blockchain-based ledger. Now, @Ripple 's CTO just quit earlier today.

Applications from Grayscale, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton create an institutional infrastructure framework comparable to Bitcoin and Ethereum precedents. XRP ETF DECISIONS COMING THIS OCTOBER! There are 6 companies awaiting SEC decisions on $XRP ETFs starting from the 2nd week of October. pic.twitter.com/vXAEZwZHEY — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) September 30, 2025 Community sentiment emphasizes “ Uptober ” narrative with discussions of “ biggest month in XRP history ” as regulatory timeline convergence with technical positioning creates compelling setup. The 2017 pattern comparison gains traction with analysts noting “XRP bullish quarterly close above the resistance for the first time since 2017, ” suggesting historical parallel formation. The technical structure mirrors previous cycle accumulation patterns preceding major appreciation phases. Market Fundamentals: Exceptional Metrics Support Institutional Confidence XRP maintains substantial positioning with $175.35 billion market cap ( +3.49% ). The market cap growth accompanies increased volume at $6.48 billion ( +34.76% ), indicating active institutional repositioning. The 3.69% volume-to-market cap ratio suggests exceptional trading activity supporting price appreciation during catalyst events such as this. Source: CoinMarketCap Additionally, a market dominance of 4.41% ( -0.15% ) shows slight weakness relative to the broader market but maintains substantial altcoin leadership positioning. However, a fully diluted valuation of $293.71 billion reflects the total network value, including future releases, while the holder count of 476,250 shows both retail interest and institutional adoption. Social Sentiment: Institutional Confidence Amid Leadership Transition LunarCrush data reveals improving social performance with XRP’s AltRank at 253 ( +12 ) during institutional developments. Galaxy Score of 68 ( +23 ) reflects an exceptional sentiment surge as participants process Japanese banking integration and ETF timeline convergence. Engagement metrics show substantial increases with 20.07 million total engagements ( +1.44M ) and 65.3K mentions ( +27.66K ). Additionally, social dominance of 3.7% ( +1.5% ) shows exceptional growth, while sentiment registers at a robust 83% positive. Prominent analysts identify 2017 pattern similarities with some projecting “ $20 by December” targets while others emphasize near-term $3.15 breakout levels. Technical discussions center on quarterly close patterns and historical cycle comparisons, suggesting major appreciation potential. ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis: Institutional Infrastructure Meets Technical Breakout ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals XRP positioned for potential psychological $3.00 breakthrough following Japanese institutional program validation and leadership transition signs. Immediate resistance emerges at the psychological $3.00 level, followed by key resistance at $3.05 – $3.10 range. Breaking above these levels would signal institutional adoption validation, driving momentum toward $3.20 – $3.30 + targets based on previous resistance structures. Source: TradingView Support structure remains exceptional with 50-day EMA ( $2.9220 ) providing immediate downside protection, followed by layered support at 100-day ( $2.8386 ) and 200-day ( $2.6160 ) EMAs. The technical setup suggests bullish bias for catalyst-driven continuation with excellent risk-reward positioning. Three-Month XRP Price Forecast: ETF and Institutional Scenarios Institutional Breakthrough (55% Probability) Successful break above $3.00 combined with October ETF approvals could drive XRP toward $3.50 – $4.00 , representing 18 – 35% upside from current levels. Source: TradingView This scenario requires regulatory validation and Japanese program scaling confirmation. Consolidation Before Launch (30% Probability) Continued resistance testing could result in consolidation between $2.85 – $3.10 , allowing institutional program development while awaiting ETF decisions before the next major catalyst-driven move. Source: TradingView Correction Risk (15% Probability) Failure at $3.00 resistance could trigger selling toward $2.85 – $2.80 support levels, representing 3 – 6% downside. Source: TradingView Recovery would depend on ETF decision outcomes and Japanese program adoption metrics. ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis: Banking Integration Validates Payment Infrastructure ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals XRP at a key inflection point between Japanese institutional banking validation and psychological resistance breakthrough requirement. Next Price Target: $3.50-$4.00 Within 90 Days The immediate trajectory requires a decisive break above $3.00 psychological resistance to validate institutional banking integration momentum. From there, ETF approval acceleration could propel XRP toward $3.50 institutional target, with sustained Japanese program scaling driving toward $4.00 + breakout levels. However, failure to break $3.00 would indicate extended consolidation toward $2.85 – $2.90 range, creating a final accumulation opportunity before the next institutional wave drives XRP toward $5.00 + targets.

        "body": "The official US government shutdown has disrupted the launch of dozens of altcoin ETFs. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s final approval process for cryptocurrency ETFs has been thrown into uncertainty with the government shutdown. The SEC was reportedly considering applications for ETFs based on various altcoins, including DOGE, XRP, and LTC. Numerous companies have submitted these applications over the past year, amid the Trump administration's more conservative approach to crypto. However, Congress' failure to reach a budget agreement on Tuesday night stalled the process. A source familiar with the matter said, “Under normal circumstances, it's safe to say the SEC ceases operations during lockdowns. There's a small possibility that SEC Chairman Paul Atkins might grant a special exemption to crypto ETFs, but that's not certain.” The SEC is not currently expected to take action to register or list new ETFs, meaning any comment letters or approval processes for applications will be suspended until the government reopens. Related News: One of Japan's Largest Financial Companies May Have Had Its Cryptocurrency Wallets Hacked - Here Are the Details Tomorrow, in particular, is a critical deadline for the Canary Litecoin ETF. However, these dates have lost their significance due to regulatory changes made by the SEC last month. The commission accepted listing standards proposed by three exchanges, allowing crypto ETFs to trade more quickly without the need for the 19b-4 process. Once the government opens up, the process could be “nearly automatic,” according to the sources. If ETF applications meet general listing standards, SEC approval could be faster than for past spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Some experts suggest that the SEC could approve individual product ETFs en masse, which could happen in October or November. However, the most critical factor here is when the registration documents will become effective. This process is entirely dependent on the decision of the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance. “As with the Solana ETF process, when applications are submitted on the same day, the institution evaluates them collectively. However, applications submitted on different days may be approached differently,” the source said, adding that there will be a heavy application traffic in the coming weeks. *This is not investment advice.

During the Token2049 event, which is taking place in Singapore, Zach Witkoff said that WLFi is actively working on integrating tokenized assets. Witkoff, who is the CEO of World Liberty Fi, expressed his thoughts and said, “I think commodities are a really interesting area for us, whether it be oil, gas, things like cotton, timber, all of those things, frankly, should be traded on chain.” He confirmed that the WLFi wants to tokenize such assets and link them to USD1 because RWAs require trustworthy and transparent stablecoins. Witkof added, “We’ve not only thought about it, we’re actively working on it.” Trump Jr. believes stablecoins preserve the dollar Donald Trump Jr. believes the rise of stablecoins strengthens the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. He explained that the growing demand for dollar-backed tokens supports US Treasuries at a time when conventional buyers such as China and Japan have reduced their exposure. “Crypto is actually going to be the thing that preserves dollar hegemony around the world,” said Trump Jr. in Singapore during a meeting. The GENIUS Act, which was passed in July, boosted confidence among stablecoin issuers and investors. Cryptopolitan reported that the stablecoin market has expanded to a new all-time high (ATH) of almost $300 billion. And around 99% of this money is in US dollar pegged stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. According to Trump Jr, this concentration shows that stablecoin users worldwide are reinforcing demand for the dollar itself. USD1 ranks sixth among other stablecoins USD1 has grown to become the sixth-largest stablecoin based on data from CoinGecko. The token has a market cap of $2.68 billion and is trading on various networks, including Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum, Solana, and Tron. The majority of the USD1 token supply is available on the BSC chain. World Liberty Financial also has WLFI, a governance token that empowers users. Together, USD1 and WLFI form the core of its ecosystem. The team is planning more products. A debit card is expected to launch between late 2025 and early 2026. A mobile app and wallet system are also in development. The Trump family continues to expand in the crypto space.

        "body": "The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF is an income-focused ETF that holds spot Bitcoin and IBIT while seeking yield via covered call strategies and exchange-listed FLEX options; it aims to reduce volatility relative to spot exposure by balancing direct Bitcoin holdings with option-based income generation. Nasdaq filed to list BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF under the commodity-based trust rule. The fund will combine spot Bitcoin and IBIT holdings with covered calls and FLEX options to generate yield. SEC review is underway; BlackRock expects compliance with generic listing standards by Q1 2026. BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF — income-focused Bitcoin ETF details, yield strategy, and SEC review. Read the filing summary and next steps. Nasdaq has filed to list BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF, designed to generate yield from Bitcoin-linked covered call strategies. Nasdaq has filed with the SEC to list the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF under the commodity-based trust rule. The ETF will generate income through covered call strategies while holding Bitcoin, IBIT, cash, and exchange-listed FLEX options. BlackRock positioned the ETF as an income-focused alternative to IBIT, expanding its digital asset product lineup while aiming to reduce volatility. Nasdaq has formally submitted a proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to list and trade the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF. The application was filed under the commodity-based trust rule on September 30. The SEC has acknowledged the submission and noted that the ETF meets the requirements under its general listing standards. What is the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF? The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF is an income-focused exchange-traded fund structured to hold spot Bitcoin and shares of IBIT while generating yield through covered call writing and exchange-listed FLEX options. The fund is positioned as an alternative to pure spot exposure, aiming to deliver income and potentially lower volatility. How will the ETF generate income and manage exposure? The ETF will primarily invest in spot Bitcoin and the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), maintain cash reserves, and sell call options on IBIT or indices that track spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products. The filing states the fund may also use exchange-listed FLEX options to fine-tune exposure and enhance yield. These option-based strategies generate premium income but can cap upside participation. Why is Nasdaq listing the ETF under the commodity-based trust rule? Nasdaq used the commodity-based trust rule because the fund’s principal asset is spot Bitcoin and related ETP shares. The commodity-based trust framework aligns the listing process with existing commodity-backed products and ensures Nasdaq’s review focuses on custody, market surveillance, and listing standards compliance. Regulatory and market context The SEC has opened a public comment period on the proposed rule change that would allow Nasdaq to list the ETF. BlackRock registered the trust in Delaware the prior week and has informed regulators the product will comply with the generic listing standards that apply beginning Q1 2026. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas (plain text) described the ETF as a sequel to IBIT in market commentary. At the time of writing, Bitcoin maintained a trading range above $114,000, with daily lows at $112,740 and highs at $114,746. Market conditions and investor appetite for yield-oriented crypto products may influence the SEC review and eventual investor demand for the income-focused ETF. How should investors evaluate an income-focused Bitcoin ETF? Evaluate the fund’s holdings, option-writing frequency, counterparty and custody arrangements, fee structure, and tax treatment. Consider how covered call strategies reduce upside during rallies and how FLEX options affect liquidity. Review BlackRock’s filing and audit/custody statements for detail on mechanics and risk controls. Frequently Asked Questions Will the ETF hold physical Bitcoin? Yes. The fund is structured to hold spot Bitcoin as its principal asset while also holding shares of IBIT and cash reserves to support option strategies and liquidity needs. When will Nasdaq and the SEC complete the review? The SEC’s public comment period is ongoing and the timeline depends on regulatory feedback; BlackRock has said the product will comply with generic listing standards from Q1 2026, which frames expectations for potential timing. Key Takeaways Income focus : The ETF seeks yield through covered calls and FLEX options while holding spot Bitcoin and IBIT. Regulatory review : Nasdaq filed under the commodity-based trust rule; the SEC is soliciting comments. Investor considerations : Covered calls can reduce upside; assess custody, fees, and option counterparties before investing.

Key point 1 — 61,000 BTC seized in 2018, linked to a Chinese investment fraud The Crown Prosecution Service has opened civil recovery in the High Court; a hearing is scheduled for January.

UK seized Bitcoin is currently held under civil recovery proceedings after convictions tied to a Chinese investment fraud; the High Court will decide whether victims receive proprietary claims to BTC or compensation in fiat, and whether the U.K. state retains any surplus following legal distribution rules. How can victims claim compensation for the seized Bitcoin? Victims can apply under Section 281 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to make proprietary claims to frozen assets. Courts will apply equitable tracing and flexible trust principles to establish entitlement. Legal precedent such as Robb v The National Crime Agency guides proportional distributions (pari passu) and valuation methods. Who are the key parties and what are the stakes? The Crown Prosecution Service is pursuing civil recovery. Defendants include Zhimin Qian (recent guilty plea) and earlier-convicted assistant Seng Hok Ling. Rough figures: around 61,000 BTC seized, over 120,000 alleged victims, and reported losses near £640 million. The potential market value swing means distribution method critically affects outcomes. How might the High Court distribute the frozen Bitcoin? Courts may adopt one of three practical approaches: pari passu proportional distribution, compensation in fiat at time-of-loss values, or permitting the state to retain surplus value. Each approach has legal and fairness implications for claimants and for public finance considerations. Comparison of potential distribution outcomes Approach What victims receive Impact on state Pari passu Proportional BTC or equivalent value based on each investor’s share State role limited to administering distribution Fiat valuation Compensation equal to amount lost in GBP State may retain appreciation in BTC value State retention Victims may receive limited or no recovery State gains from market appreciation When is the next legal step in the case? The Crown Prosecution Service has initiated proceedings and the High Court will hear the next stage in January. Civil litigation could continue into 2027 depending on tracing complexity and the number of claimants. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How victims can pursue claims on seized Bitcoin\", \"description\": \"Step-by-step guide to submitting a civil recovery claim for frozen Bitcoin held by the UK.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Collect evidence\", \"text\": \"Gather records of payments, account details, and communications proving investment and loss.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Submit claim under Proceeds of Crime Act\", \"text\": \"File an application under Section 281 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to register a claim on frozen property.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Seek legal representation\", \"text\": \"Engage solicitors experienced in asset tracing and civil recovery to present proprietary or equitable tracing arguments.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Attend hearings\", \"text\": \"Participate in High Court civil recovery hearings and any distribution determinations.\" } ]} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Can the UK government legally keep seized Bitcoin?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"The UK government has initiated civil recovery but retention is not guaranteed; courts may award victims proprietary claims or fiat compensation under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 depending on tracing and precedent.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How much Bitcoin was seized in 2018?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Approximately 61,000 BTC was seized in connection with an investment fraud linked to Zhimin Qian and associates.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"What legal precedent affects distribution?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Robb v The National Crime Agency and equitable tracing principles inform proportional distribution (pari passu) and valuation choices in civil recovery cases.\" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Can victims recover Bitcoin or only fiat compensation? Victims may recover proprietary interests in BTC if they can trace funds to the seized assets. Courts sometimes award compensation in GBP equal to losses instead, which can leave the state with appreciation in BTC value. What legal tools are victims using to claim recovery? Claimants use Section 281 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, equitable tracing, and trust law arguments. London-based law firms represent many victims and coordinate cross-jurisdictional claims. Key Takeaways Seized amount: ~61,000 BTC taken in 2018 tied to an investment fraud. Legal path: Civil recovery in the High Court will determine rightful recipients under established tracing and distribution principles. Impact: Distribution method (pari passu vs fiat valuation) will decide if victims receive market gains or only original losses. Conclusion The dispute over the UK seized Bitcoin centers on competing legal principles: victims’ proprietary claims versus the state’s civil recovery prerogative. Upcoming High Court hearings and established case law will shape whether victims regain BTC value or receive fiat compensation. Monitor the January hearing and prepare documentation if you are a claimant.",

        "body": "ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals XRP surging +3.78% to $2.9543 with strong bullish momentum as the Bank of Japan’s SBI announces an official XRP lending program for institutional payments, while Ripple CTO David Schwartz announces his exit from the company . At the same time, XRP shows exceptional technical strength, trading above all major EMAs, including the 20-day ( $2.5049 ), 50-day ( $2.9220 ), 100-day ( $2.8386 ), and 200-day ( $2.6160 ) support levels, positioning it for a potential $3.00 + breakthrough amid the October ETF decision timeline. ChatGPT’s XRP analysis synthesizes 23 + real-time technical indicators to assess XRP’s trajectory, while testing psychological $3.00 resistance with multiple ETF decisions pending. Technical Analysis: Strong Bullish Structure Above All EMAs XRP’s current price of $2.9543 reflects a robust +3.78% gain from the opening price of $2.8468 , establishing a volatile trading range between $2.9550 (high) and $2.8141 (low). This 4.8% intraday range demonstrates exceptional volatility typical of major institutional catalyst responses. Source: TradingView The RSI at 52.52 maintains neutral positioning, providing substantial room for upside continuation without overbought conditions. Moving averages reveal exceptional bullish positioning with XRP trading above all EMAs: 20-day at $2.5049 ( -15.2% ), 50-day at $2.9220 ( -1.1% ), 100-day at $2.8386 ( -3.9% ), and 200-day at $2.6160 ( -11.5% ). MACD also shows slight bearish positioning at -0.0012 just below zero with the signal line at -0.0266 , but a negative histogram at -0.0254 indicates improving momentum divergence. Source: TradingView Similarly, volume analysis shows exceptional activity at 97.71 million XRP, indicating massive institutional participation during the Bank of Japan announcement and CTO transition processing. The ATR maintains high readings at 2.5709 , suggesting continued volatility potential for moves toward psychological resistance levels. Market Context: Bank of Japan Integration Validates Institutional Utility XRP’s surge follows the Bank of Japan’s SBI announcement of an official XRP lending program , representing unprecedented institutional validation. Community analysis highlights “Bank of Japan (SBI) announces official $XRP lending program,” signaling “ Japan is preparing to utilize XRP for institutional payments at scale .” The Japanese institutional integration provides concrete utility validation beyond speculation, with XRP surpassing Bitcoin in trading volume on South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit, demonstrating accelerated Asian institutional demand. This geographic concentration suggests systematic regional adoption patterns. Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s transition to CTO Emeritus after 13 years marks a sign of institutional maturation rather than weakness. Community interpretation suggests “XRP is ready to run without him” as infrastructure development reaches the self-sustaining institutional adoption phase, requiring less founder dependency. Partnership expansion continues with Ondo Finance tokenizing U.S. treasuries on the XRP Ledger, while discussions on SWIFT integration persist despite recent Chainlink collaboration announcements. Horrendous week to be an $XRP holder. First, SWIFT announces that it's working with @chainlink and @Consensys on a blockchain-based ledger. Now, @Ripple 's CTO just quit earlier today. Can it get any worse than this for $XRP holders? pic.twitter.com/pR7ZrxMxiN — jfab.eth (@josefabregab) October 1, 2025 ETF Timeline Convergence Creates October Catalyst Framework October presents a massive convergence of catalysts with seven spot XRP ETF applications pending SEC decisions, beginning on October 18 . Applications from Grayscale, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton create an institutional infrastructure framework comparable to Bitcoin and Ethereum precedents. XRP ETF DECISIONS COMING THIS OCTOBER! There are 6 companies awaiting SEC decisions on $XRP ETFs starting from the 2nd week of October. pic.twitter.com/vXAEZwZHEY — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) September 30, 2025 Community sentiment emphasizes “ Uptober ” narrative with discussions of “ biggest month in XRP history ” as regulatory timeline convergence with technical positioning creates compelling setup. The 2017 pattern comparison gains traction with analysts noting “XRP bullish quarterly close above the resistance for the first time since 2017, ” suggesting historical parallel formation. The technical structure mirrors previous cycle accumulation patterns preceding major appreciation phases. Market Fundamentals: Exceptional Metrics Support Institutional Confidence XRP maintains substantial positioning with $175.35 billion market cap ( +3.49% ). The market cap growth accompanies increased volume at $6.48 billion ( +34.76% ), indicating active institutional repositioning. The 3.69% volume-to-market cap ratio suggests exceptional trading activity supporting price appreciation during catalyst events such as this. Source: CoinMarketCap Additionally, a market dominance of 4.41% ( -0.15% ) shows slight weakness relative to the broader market but maintains substantial altcoin leadership positioning. However, a fully diluted valuation of $293.71 billion reflects the total network value, including future releases, while the holder count of 476,250 shows both retail interest and institutional adoption. Social Sentiment: Institutional Confidence Amid Leadership Transition LunarCrush data reveals improving social performance with XRP’s AltRank at 253 ( +12 ) during institutional developments. Galaxy Score of 68 ( +23 ) reflects an exceptional sentiment surge as participants process Japanese banking integration and ETF timeline convergence. Engagement metrics show substantial increases with 20.07 million total engagements ( +1.44M ) and 65.3K mentions ( +27.66K ). Additionally, social dominance of 3.7% ( +1.5% ) shows exceptional growth, while sentiment registers at a robust 83% positive. Prominent analysts identify 2017 pattern similarities with some projecting “ $20 by December” targets while others emphasize near-term $3.15 breakout levels. Technical discussions center on quarterly close patterns and historical cycle comparisons, suggesting major appreciation potential. ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis: Institutional Infrastructure Meets Technical Breakout ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals XRP positioned for potential psychological $3.00 breakthrough following Japanese institutional program validation and leadership transition signs. Immediate resistance emerges at the psychological $3.00 level, followed by key resistance at $3.05 – $3.10 range. Breaking above these levels would signal institutional adoption validation, driving momentum toward $3.20 – $3.30 + targets based on previous resistance structures. Source: TradingView Support structure remains exceptional with 50-day EMA ( $2.9220 ) providing immediate downside protection, followed by layered support at 100-day ( $2.8386 ) and 200-day ( $2.6160 ) EMAs. The technical setup suggests bullish bias for catalyst-driven continuation with excellent risk-reward positioning. Three-Month XRP Price Forecast: ETF and Institutional Scenarios Institutional Breakthrough (55% Probability) Successful break above $3.00 combined with October ETF approvals could drive XRP toward $3.50 – $4.00 , representing 18 – 35% upside from current levels. Source: TradingView This scenario requires regulatory validation and Japanese program scaling confirmation. Consolidation Before Launch (30% Probability) Continued resistance testing could result in consolidation between $2.85 – $3.10 , allowing institutional program development while awaiting ETF decisions before the next major catalyst-driven move. Source: TradingView Correction Risk (15% Probability) Failure at $3.00 resistance could trigger selling toward $2.85 – $2.80 support levels, representing 3 – 6% downside. Source: TradingView Recovery would depend on ETF decision outcomes and Japanese program adoption metrics. ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis: Banking Integration Validates Payment Infrastructure ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals XRP at a key inflection point between Japanese institutional banking validation and psychological resistance breakthrough requirement. Next Price Target: $3.50-$4.00 Within 90 Days The immediate trajectory requires a decisive break above $3.00 psychological resistance to validate institutional banking integration momentum. From there, ETF approval acceleration could propel XRP toward $3.50 institutional target, with sustained Japanese program scaling driving toward $4.00 + breakout levels. However, failure to break $3.00 would indicate extended consolidation toward $2.85 – $2.90 range, creating a final accumulation opportunity before the next institutional wave drives XRP toward $5.00 + targets.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-falls-below-210-as-investors-turn-to-mutuum-finance-mutm-for-q4-profits/",
        "body": "Solana (SOL) has dropped below the critical $210 level this week, with profit-taking and volatility within the wider market exacting a toll on investor sentiment. While SOL’s fundamentals remain strong, many traders are now turning to other alternatives with better near-term growth potential, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as a front-runner. Prevalently priced at just $0.035 in its stage 6 presale, Mutuum Finance is building one of the most ambitious decentralized finance ecosystems of 2025, with peer-to-peer and pooled lending, without sacrificing asset custody. The stage is already over 50% sold out. The project’s novelty has already attracted more than 16,670 holders and more than $16.6 million worth of presale investments, a testament to growing confidence among crypto whales as well as retail investors alike. With both high-upside tokenomics and early-stage momentum along with real-world utility, analysts believe that MUTM could report much stronger Q4 returns compared to industry titans like Solana. Solana Tests Crucial Support, Can Bulls Regain Control Before Year-End Solana (SOL) trades at around $202.48, testing a critical rising trendline that can determine its next move. Having both the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages is offering support, with the primary Fibonacci retracement levels between $214 and $223 determining short-term momentum. A decisive breakout above the range could pave the way for upside objectives at $253, $274, $301, and even $331, representing a strong bullish follow-through to Q4. However, failure to hold current levels and breakdown below $175 could accelerate losses towards $158 or $140, further constricting pressure on market sentiment. As traders gaze upon these key levels, investors already have their eyes on new prospects with better near-term upside, and that’s progressively turning heads to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Hits New Heights Mutuum Finance is dominating the DeFi space with its presale, garnering over 16,670 investors and raising over $16.6 million up to now. The presale has progressed to Phase 6 and is 50% through, with the MUTM tokens costing $0.035 apiece. As a token of gratitude to its initial supporters, the team has also initiated a $100,000 giveaway , distributing 10 winners $10,000 of MUTM tokens each. At the forefront of decentralized finance innovation, Mutuum Finance leverages Chainlink oracles to enable safe exchange, lending, and settlement for USD-backed tokens, as well as extremely liquid tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform ensures robust data integrity with multiple defense layers, including fallback oracle guards, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages, providing accurate and reliable price data even with brutal market conditions. Mutuum Finance also introduces a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that fall apart in bear markets, the token is overcollateralized and non-algorithmic, designed to provide price stability even during market downturns. The platform possesses a risk-adjusted Loan-to-Value (LTV) mechanism where each asset has an associated collateral ceiling attuned to its risk profile. This maintains lending in balance and at bay. In addition to the security of users during periods of volatility, the protocol features a buffer reserve mechanism where riskier assets are assigned increased reserves as additional collateral and to cover the ecosystem. With its record-breaking presale, innovative risk management, and commitment to transparency, Mutuum Finance is solidifying its reputation as a secure, robust, and visionary DeFi platform. Why Whales Are Switching to MUTM Instead of SOL Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to become one of the hottest DeFi projects of 2025, raising over $16.6 million from more than 16,670 investors and 50% through its Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per token. While Solana (SOL) journeys through volatility below $210, MUTM’s peer-to-peer lending and collective lending platform, USD-backed stablecoin, and sound risk management system are attracting serious attention from both retail and whales. Those seeking high-upside utility-focused crypto plays must lock in MUTM tokens prior to the presale event being complete. Join now.

        "body": "World Liberty Fi is exploring different ways to adopt real-world assets (RWAs) and link them to its native and dollar-backed stablecoin, USD1. During the Token2049 event, which is taking place in Singapore, Zach Witkoff said that WLFi is actively working on integrating tokenized assets. Witkoff, who is the CEO of World Liberty Fi, expressed his thoughts and said, “I think commodities are a really interesting area for us, whether it be oil, gas, things like cotton, timber, all of those things, frankly, should be traded on chain.” He confirmed that the WLFi wants to tokenize such assets and link them to USD1 because RWAs require trustworthy and transparent stablecoins. Witkof added, “We’ve not only thought about it, we’re actively working on it.” Trump Jr. believes stablecoins preserve the dollar Donald Trump Jr. believes the rise of stablecoins strengthens the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. He explained that the growing demand for dollar-backed tokens supports US Treasuries at a time when conventional buyers such as China and Japan have reduced their exposure. “Crypto is actually going to be the thing that preserves dollar hegemony around the world,” said Trump Jr. in Singapore during a meeting. The GENIUS Act, which was passed in July, boosted confidence among stablecoin issuers and investors. Cryptopolitan reported that the stablecoin market has expanded to a new all-time high (ATH) of almost $300 billion. And around 99% of this money is in US dollar pegged stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. According to Trump Jr, this concentration shows that stablecoin users worldwide are reinforcing demand for the dollar itself. USD1 ranks sixth among other stablecoins USD1 has grown to become the sixth-largest stablecoin based on data from CoinGecko. The token has a market cap of $2.68 billion and is trading on various networks, including Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum, Solana, and Tron. The majority of the USD1 token supply is available on the BSC chain. World Liberty Financial also has WLFI, a governance token that empowers users. Together, USD1 and WLFI form the core of its ecosystem. The team is planning more products. A debit card is expected to launch between late 2025 and early 2026. A mobile app and wallet system are also in development. The Trump family continues to expand in the crypto space. Recently, Trump Jr, along with his brother Eric, launched a mining company called American Bitcoin. The company trades on Nasdaq under the ticker ABTC. Its stock closed at $7.20, up 6.82%.

        "body": "Solana (SOL) has dropped below the critical $210 level this week, with profit-taking and volatility within the wider market exacting a toll on investor sentiment. While SOL’s fundamentals remain strong, many traders are now turning to other alternatives with better near-term growth potential, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as a front-runner. Prevalently priced at just $0.035 in its stage 6 presale, Mutuum Finance is building one of the most ambitious decentralized finance ecosystems of 2025, with peer-to-peer and pooled lending, without sacrificing asset custody. The stage is already over 50% sold out. The project’s novelty has already attracted more than 16,670 holders and more than $16.6 million worth of presale investments, a testament to growing confidence among crypto whales as well as retail investors alike. With both high-upside tokenomics and early-stage momentum along with real-world utility, analysts believe that MUTM could report much stronger Q4 returns compared to industry titans like Solana. Solana Tests Crucial Support, Can Bulls Regain Control Before Year-End Solana (SOL) trades at around $202.48, testing a critical rising trendline that can determine its next move. Having both the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages is offering support, with the primary Fibonacci retracement levels between $214 and $223 determining short-term momentum. A decisive breakout above the range could pave the way for upside objectives at $253, $274, $301, and even $331, representing a strong bullish follow-through to Q4. However, failure to hold current levels and breakdown below $175 could accelerate losses towards $158 or $140, further constricting pressure on market sentiment. As traders gaze upon these key levels, investors already have their eyes on new prospects with better near-term upside, and that’s progressively turning heads to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Hits New Heights Mutuum Finance is dominating the DeFi space with its presale, garnering over 16,670 investors and raising over $16.6 million up to now. The presale has progressed to Phase 6 and is 50% through, with the MUTM tokens costing $0.035 apiece. As a token of gratitude to its initial supporters, the team has also initiated a $100,000 giveaway , distributing 10 winners $10,000 of MUTM tokens each. At the forefront of decentralized finance innovation, Mutuum Finance leverages Chainlink oracles to enable safe exchange, lending, and settlement for USD-backed tokens, as well as extremely liquid tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform ensures robust data integrity with multiple defense layers, including fallback oracle guards, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages, providing accurate and reliable price data even with brutal market conditions. Mutuum Finance also introduces a USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that fall apart in bear markets, the token is overcollateralized and non-algorithmic, designed to provide price stability even during market downturns. The platform possesses a risk-adjusted Loan-to-Value (LTV) mechanism where each asset has an associated collateral ceiling attuned to its risk profile. This maintains lending in balance and at bay. In addition to the security of users during periods of volatility, the protocol features a buffer reserve mechanism where riskier assets are assigned increased reserves as additional collateral and to cover the ecosystem. With its record-breaking presale, innovative risk management, and commitment to transparency, Mutuum Finance is solidifying its reputation as a secure, robust, and visionary DeFi platform. Why Whales Are Switching to MUTM Instead of SOL Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to become one of the hottest DeFi projects of 2025, raising over $16.6 million from more than 16,670 investors and 50% through its Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per token. While Solana (SOL) journeys through volatility below $210, MUTM’s peer-to-peer lending and collective lending platform, USD-backed stablecoin, and sound risk management system are attracting serious attention from both retail and whales. Those seeking high-upside utility-focused crypto plays must lock in MUTM tokens prior to the presale event being complete. Join now.

        "title": "Analyst Says XRP Price Remains Bullish As This Level Holds",
        "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-remains-bullish/",
        "body": "XRP’s price action in the final days of September was turbulent, with the cryptocurrency slipping below the $2.80 zone in a market-wide pullback. Despite the sharp drop, XRP managed to defend a key support level near $2.72, bouncing from that mark on September 26. This recovery, though modest, has led to new analysis suggesting that as long as this support holds, XRP could be positioned to lead the next rally in the market. $2.72 Support Is The Line In The Sand Technical analysis of XRP’s weekly candlestick timeframe chart shows that the cryptocurrency’s outlook is now bullish after holding up above an important level. This analysis, which was shared on the social media platform X, predicted that as long as this support holds, XRP could be positioned to lead the next rally for the entire crypto market. The analyst noted the importance of the $2.72 level as an important support level that XRP has held up. This is in relation to how the XRP price broke below $2.8 last week. After crashing below $2.8, XRP managed to hold above $2.72, rebounding on it on September 26. Now, this move is what made XRP to be bullish. According to the analyst, the successful defense of this support, followed by a close back above $2.80, has created the conditions for a slight bullish divergence. The weekly chart supports this view, showing that XRP has consistently rebounded on higher lows while maintaining a broader ascending structure. Holding $2.72 prevents a breakdown of this pattern and keeps the longer-term uptrend intact. XRP’s Strength Against The Market Even in the face of the recent correction, the analysis pointed out that XRP is one of the stronger performers in the market. The chart comparison with XRP dominance (XRP.D) indicates that the token may have already bottomed in relative terms. According to the analyst, the XRP dominance bottoming means that the crypto can only start going up from here. This dominance means that XRP could play a leadership role if the broader crypto market begins to trend higher again. Although the bullish case is worth noting, the analyst also warned against complacency among bullish traders. The start of a new week and month often brings volatility, and October could also start with some sort of volatility. As such, the XRP price could still experience a flush lower before any meaningful rally takes hold. However, this capitulation moment could be the final shakeout before XRP begins a stronger leg upward. The $2.72 support has become the line that separates the continuation of XRP’s bullish structure. As long as that level holds, the cryptocurrency’s outlook is bullish. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.85, meaning that it has effectively registered a bullish close above $2.8.",

At the same time, XRP shows exceptional technical strength, trading above all major EMAs, including the 20-day ( $2.5049 ), 50-day ( $2.9220 ), 100-day ( $2.8386 ), and 200-day ( $2.6160 ) support levels, positioning it for a potential $3.00 + breakthrough amid the October ETF decision timeline. ChatGPT’s XRP analysis synthesizes 23 + real-time technical indicators to assess XRP’s trajectory, while testing psychological $3.00 resistance with multiple ETF decisions pending. Technical Analysis: Strong Bullish Structure Above All EMAs XRP’s current price of $2.9543 reflects a robust +3.78% gain from the opening price of $2.8468 , establishing a volatile trading range between $2.9550 (high) and $2.8141 (low). This 4.8% intraday range demonstrates exceptional volatility typical of major institutional catalyst responses. Source: TradingView The RSI at 52.52 maintains neutral positioning, providing substantial room for upside continuation without overbought conditions. Moving averages reveal exceptional bullish positioning with XRP trading above all EMAs: 20-day at $2.5049 ( -15.2% ), 50-day at $2.9220 ( -1.1% ), 100-day at $2.8386 ( -3.9% ), and 200-day at $2.6160 ( -11.5% ). MACD also shows slight bearish positioning at -0.0012 just below zero with the signal line at -0.0266 , but a negative histogram at -0.0254 indicates improving momentum divergence. Source: TradingView Similarly, volume analysis shows exceptional activity at 97.71 million XRP, indicating massive institutional participation during the Bank of Japan announcement and CTO transition processing. The ATR maintains high readings at 2.5709 , suggesting continued volatility potential for moves toward psychological resistance levels. Market Context: Bank of Japan Integration Validates Institutional Utility XRP’s surge follows the Bank of Japan’s SBI announcement of an official XRP lending program , representing unprecedented institutional validation. Community analysis highlights “Bank of Japan (SBI) announces official $XRP lending program,” signaling “ Japan is preparing to utilize XRP for institutional payments at scale .” The Japanese institutional integration provides concrete utility validation beyond speculation, with XRP surpassing Bitcoin in trading volume on South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit, demonstrating accelerated Asian institutional demand. This geographic concentration suggests systematic regional adoption patterns. Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s transition to CTO Emeritus after 13 years marks a sign of institutional maturation rather than weakness. Community interpretation suggests “XRP is ready to run without him” as infrastructure development reaches the self-sustaining institutional adoption phase, requiring less founder dependency. Partnership expansion continues with Ondo Finance tokenizing U.S. treasuries on the XRP Ledger, while discussions on SWIFT integration persist despite recent Chainlink collaboration announcements. Horrendous week to be an $XRP holder. First, SWIFT announces that it's working with @chainlink and @Consensys on a blockchain-based ledger. Now, @Ripple 's CTO just quit earlier today.

The 2017 pattern comparison gains traction with analysts noting “XRP bullish quarterly close above the resistance for the first time since 2017, ” suggesting historical parallel formation. The technical structure mirrors previous cycle accumulation patterns preceding major appreciation phases. Market Fundamentals: Exceptional Metrics Support Institutional Confidence XRP maintains substantial positioning with $175.35 billion market cap ( +3.49% ). The market cap growth accompanies increased volume at $6.48 billion ( +34.76% ), indicating active institutional repositioning. The 3.69% volume-to-market cap ratio suggests exceptional trading activity supporting price appreciation during catalyst events such as this. Source: CoinMarketCap Additionally, a market dominance of 4.41% ( -0.15% ) shows slight weakness relative to the broader market but maintains substantial altcoin leadership positioning. However, a fully diluted valuation of $293.71 billion reflects the total network value, including future releases, while the holder count of 476,250 shows both retail interest and institutional adoption. Social Sentiment: Institutional Confidence Amid Leadership Transition LunarCrush data reveals improving social performance with XRP’s AltRank at 253 ( +12 ) during institutional developments. Galaxy Score of 68 ( +23 ) reflects an exceptional sentiment surge as participants process Japanese banking integration and ETF timeline convergence. Engagement metrics show substantial increases with 20.07 million total engagements ( +1.44M ) and 65.3K mentions ( +27.66K ). Additionally, social dominance of 3.7% ( +1.5% ) shows exceptional growth, while sentiment registers at a robust 83% positive. Prominent analysts identify 2017 pattern similarities with some projecting “ $20 by December” targets while others emphasize near-term $3.15 breakout levels. Technical discussions center on quarterly close patterns and historical cycle comparisons, suggesting major appreciation potential. ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis: Institutional Infrastructure Meets Technical Breakout ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals XRP positioned for potential psychological $3.00 breakthrough following Japanese institutional program validation and leadership transition signs. Immediate resistance emerges at the psychological $3.00 level, followed by key resistance at $3.05 – $3.10 range. Breaking above these levels would signal institutional adoption validation, driving momentum toward $3.20 – $3.30 + targets based on previous resistance structures. Source: TradingView Support structure remains exceptional with 50-day EMA ( $2.9220 ) providing immediate downside protection, followed by layered support at 100-day ( $2.8386 ) and 200-day ( $2.6160 ) EMAs. The technical setup suggests bullish bias for catalyst-driven continuation with excellent risk-reward positioning. Three-Month XRP Price Forecast: ETF and Institutional Scenarios Institutional Breakthrough (55% Probability) Successful break above $3.00 combined with October ETF approvals could drive XRP toward $3.50 – $4.00 , representing 18 – 35% upside from current levels. Source: TradingView This scenario requires regulatory validation and Japanese program scaling confirmation. Consolidation Before Launch (30% Probability) Continued resistance testing could result in consolidation between $2.85 – $3.10 , allowing institutional program development while awaiting ETF decisions before the next major catalyst-driven move. Source: TradingView Correction Risk (15% Probability) Failure at $3.00 resistance could trigger selling toward $2.85 – $2.80 support levels, representing 3 – 6% downside. Source: TradingView Recovery would depend on ETF decision outcomes and Japanese program adoption metrics. ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis: Banking Integration Validates Payment Infrastructure ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals XRP at a key inflection point between Japanese institutional banking validation and psychological resistance breakthrough requirement. Next Price Target: $3.50-$4.00 Within 90 Days The immediate trajectory requires a decisive break above $3.00 psychological resistance to validate institutional banking integration momentum. From there, ETF approval acceleration could propel XRP toward $3.50 institutional target, with sustained Japanese program scaling driving toward $4.00 + breakout levels. However, failure to break $3.00 would indicate extended consolidation toward $2.85 – $2.90 range, creating a final accumulation opportunity before the next institutional wave drives XRP toward $5.00 + targets.

        "body": "The official US government shutdown has disrupted the launch of dozens of altcoin ETFs. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s final approval process for cryptocurrency ETFs has been thrown into uncertainty with the government shutdown. The SEC was reportedly considering applications for ETFs based on various altcoins, including DOGE, XRP, and LTC. Numerous companies have submitted these applications over the past year, amid the Trump administration's more conservative approach to crypto. However, Congress' failure to reach a budget agreement on Tuesday night stalled the process. A source familiar with the matter said, “Under normal circumstances, it's safe to say the SEC ceases operations during lockdowns. There's a small possibility that SEC Chairman Paul Atkins might grant a special exemption to crypto ETFs, but that's not certain.” The SEC is not currently expected to take action to register or list new ETFs, meaning any comment letters or approval processes for applications will be suspended until the government reopens. Related News: One of Japan's Largest Financial Companies May Have Had Its Cryptocurrency Wallets Hacked - Here Are the Details Tomorrow, in particular, is a critical deadline for the Canary Litecoin ETF. However, these dates have lost their significance due to regulatory changes made by the SEC last month. The commission accepted listing standards proposed by three exchanges, allowing crypto ETFs to trade more quickly without the need for the 19b-4 process. Once the government opens up, the process could be “nearly automatic,” according to the sources. If ETF applications meet general listing standards, SEC approval could be faster than for past spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Some experts suggest that the SEC could approve individual product ETFs en masse, which could happen in October or November. However, the most critical factor here is when the registration documents will become effective. This process is entirely dependent on the decision of the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance. “As with the Solana ETF process, when applications are submitted on the same day, the institution evaluates them collectively. However, applications submitted on different days may be approached differently,” the source said, adding that there will be a heavy application traffic in the coming weeks. *This is not investment advice.

        "url": "https://timestabloid.com/heres-ripples-grand-plan-for-swift-according-to-chris-larsen/",
        "body": "For decades, SWIFT has been the undisputed backbone of cross-border banking, facilitating trillions in global payments daily. But Ripple’s leadership believes the system’s inefficiencies have left room for disruption — and they’ve never hidden their ambition to step into that space. A recent clip shared by Digital Asset Investor has reignited this conversation, highlighting Ripple’s co-founder, Chris Larsen, and CEO Brad Garlinghouse, outlining nothing short of a takeover strategy. Chris Larsen’s Vision In the video circulated by Digital Asset Investor, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen described the company’s work as “a replacement for SWIFT in correspondent banking.” According to Larsen, Ripple’s approach centers on connecting payment providers and wallets through ILP, using XRP to provide on-demand liquidity. By doing so, financial institutions could avoid maintaining pre-funded accounts across multiple jurisdictions — a system Larsen criticized as inefficient. “We think that’s a winning kind of killer app,” he added, positioning Ripple’s solution as a direct challenge to the current correspondent banking model. I'm confused by all the Swift FUD. Ripple never said they were going to partner with Swift. They said they were going to replace or take it over. https://t.co/9VqGiCEbyC — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) October 1, 2025 Brad Garlinghouse: From Competing to “Taking Over” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse reinforced this bold positioning, famously remarking in earlier interviews that Ripple is “taking over SWIFT.” In the same vein, he highlighted the company’s traction with global banks, pointing out that Ripple had already signed up over 100 financial institutions. This language makes clear that Ripple sees itself less as a complementary partner to SWIFT and more as an outright competitor seeking to displace it. The Technology Behind Ripple’s Ambition At the core of Ripple’s strategy is ILP, a protocol designed to bridge disparate payment networks. Unlike SWIFT, which primarily functions as a secure messaging system for banks, ILP aims to route actual value across ledgers. When paired with XRP as an on-demand liquidity asset, this infrastructure promises faster settlements and reduced reliance on nostro/vostro accounts. Still, while ILP’s technical framework is sound, scaling it across thousands of global financial institutions remains a monumental challenge. Adoption depends on regulation, institutional confidence, and a willingness by banks to shift away from decades-old systems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Adoption, Regulation, and Reality Check Ripple has actively pursued steps to bolster its legitimacy in the financial sector, including applying for a U.S. national bank charter. These moves indicate a long-term plan to further integrate with traditional banking systems. However, while Ripple frequently cites its growing list of partners , independent verification of the scale of XRP-based transaction volumes remains limited. Analysts note that while Ripple has achieved notable pilot programs and partnerships, replacing SWIFT — with its network of over 11,000 institutions worldwide — is a marathon, not a sprint. The gap between bold executive statements and verifiable market dominance remains significant. The Road Ahead Ripple’s leaders have made it clear: their mission is not to work alongside SWIFT but to offer a superior alternative. Digital Asset Investor’s resurfacing of Larsen’s and Garlinghouse’s words underscores just how ambitious that mission is. The real test, however, lies in execution. Verified bank adoption, transparent transaction data, and regulatory approvals will determine whether Ripple’s “killer app” evolves from vision to global reality. Until then, the debate around whether Ripple can truly replace SWIFT will remain one of the most-watched storylines in the fintech and crypto landscape.

        "body": "Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, has ignited a notable recovery in the broader cryptocurrency market, recording a 5% gain during Wednesday’s trading session to recover the $117,000 mark. This momentum has positively impacted major altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Binance Coin (BNB), which have seen average increases of around 3% in what may signal the onset of a new altcoin season. Crypto Prices Surge Amidst US Government Shutdown The surge in crypto prices coincided with political developments as the US Senate’s failure to pass a temporary funding bill resulted in a government shutdown shortly after midnight on Wednesday. Related Reading: Did Bitcoin Top? Top Trader Warns Of Brutal $98,000 Liquidity Sweep Such uncertainty often leads investors to seek alternatives to the US dollar, and cryptocurrencies are increasingly viewed as a hedge against economic instability. On Wednesday, the dollar remained stable against a basket of other currencies, further bolstering the appeal of digital assets. Historically, October has been a favorable month for Bitcoin, with the cryptocurrency finishing in positive territory 10 out of the past 12 years. Joel Kruger from LMAX Group also noted that Q4 has consistently been the strongest seasonal period for cryptocurrencies, adding to the bullish sentiment. However, not all analysts share the same optimistic outlook. Extended Bull Cycle For Bitcoin? Ash Crypto expressed caution, suggesting that the current rally might be a precursor to a more significant downturn, predicting a potential drop that could see Bitcoin retrace to around $106,000 and Ethereum to near $3,800. This anticipated correction, he argues, could liquidate overly optimistic positions, particularly among retail investors. He forecasts that this phase of uncertainty could persist until mid-October, potentially leading to a market rebound when bearish sentiment peaks. Related Reading: XRP Flips Green For First Time Since 2017, Pundit Predicts 500% Rally Conversely, Lark Davis has indicated a more bullish long-term perspective, suggesting that the current cycle may extend well into 2026 rather than peaking in the fourth quarter of the year as traditionally expected. The general sentiment remains that if the market can navigate through the short-term fluctuations, a substantial rally could occur, potentially driving Bitcoin to prices between $150,000 and $180,000, with Ethereum reaching between $8,000 and $12,000. According to Davis, such a scenario, in which could result in a major 53% and 200% for BTC and ETH respectively, could catalyze a significant altcoin season, with some assets potentially increasing in value by 10 to 50 times within just a few months. When writing, Bitcoin trades at $117,130, further posting gains of nearly 8% on the monthly time frame. This positions the market’s leading cryptocurrency just 5.7% below its all-time high, currently at $124,100, Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

        "body": "Crypto charts in Q4 2025 are flashing like neon signs, and community members are chasing signals harder than ever. Bitcoin is holding key levels, Ethereum’s upgrade cycle is building anticipation, and meme tokens are leading a fresh round of viral rallies. Conversations are shifting from “what’s safe” to “what’s next,” and new meme coin projects are pulling attention away from the usual heavyweights. Every scroll through trading apps shows whales stacking, and participants debating whether to grab bags or stay sidelined. At the center of this growing buzz, MoonBull ($MOBU) is being called the boldest entry of the season. MoonBull ($MOBU) launched with mechanics designed to cut through the noise and deliver serious conviction. Alongside other projects like Dogecoin, which remains the meme market pioneer, and BullZilla, a beast that refuses to be ignored, these names are setting the pace for October’s meme run. With a unique structure, community-first tokenomics, and a rising tally in its presale, MoonBull is carving out its lane as the new upcoming crypto in 2025 that participants refuse to overlook. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU) Headlines the Meme Market With Strong Presale Surge MoonBull isn’t just a playful ticker; it’s a project engineered with scarcity and sustainability in mind. In its 4th presale stage, the token is priced at $0.00005168, already pulling in over $200,000 from more than 600 holders. For early buyers, the ROI from stage entry to its projected listing price of $0.00616 already exceeds 11,800%, while those who joined from the earliest stages secured a 106% gain. With the next stage marking a 27.40% increase, the design leaves little room for hesitation. Every stage is more than just a number, it’s an acceleration point built to reward conviction. The mechanics backing MoonBull ensure stability doesn’t just depend on market chatter. Through 2% liquidity injections, 2% passive reflections, and 1% permanent burns, the contract transforms selling pressure into fuel for the system. Community members aren’t simply waiting for pumps; they’re rewarded every step of the way. Its staking program, kicking off with a massive 95% APY pool, makes holding more than just a bag—it makes it a growth machine. Tied to Ethereum’s secure ERC-20 base, and governed by its own community vote from Stage 12, MoonBull is positioning itself as the new upcoming crypto in 2025 that blends meme culture with formal mechanics like no other. 2. Dogecoin Holds Its Meme Crown in Q4 2025 Dogecoin continues to stand as the face of meme coins, a name that refuses to fade even when new entrants flood the market. In Q4 2025, trading activity remains consistent, driven by its presence across nearly every exchange and wallet. Dogecoin thrives on community-driven value, its memes still circulating as hard as its transactions. While the price doesn’t mirror the wild rallies of its early days, its stability and recognition keep it a trusted pick among community members who want a familiar coin with historic credibility. October sees Dogecoin leaning further into mainstream integration, with merchant adoption campaigns making headlines again. The loyal Doge army has turned memes into markets, keeping Dogecoin firmly within the conversation. While new coins pop up daily, Dogecoin’s mix of longevity and relatability keeps it in the spotlight, proving that even the oldest meme projects can thrive when community belief refuses to die. 3. BullZilla Roars Into October as a Top Meme Coin to Buy Now BullZilla has gained traction by branding itself as the monster coin of 2025. Its design merges humor with power, positioning it as a meme coin that refuses to stay in the shadows. In October, BullZilla’s narrative has been fueled by rising mentions across online communities, particularly among those chasing fresh meme picks. The project thrives on virality, tapping into larger-than-life branding that makes it hard to ignore in a crowd of smaller tokens. Beyond the memes, BullZilla has leaned into strong liquidity injections and gamified community incentives. By rewarding active holders with access to limited events and unique engagement bonuses, it builds an identity that stretches beyond trading charts. As one of the top meme coins to buy now , BullZilla carries the meme market energy of 2021 into 2025, proving that fresh branding and consistent community backing can turn a playful name into a coin worth watching. 4. Shiba Inu Pushes Forward With Ecosystem Expansion Shiba Inu has been more than just Dogecoin’s rival; it’s been building its own sprawling ecosystem. In Q4 2025, Shiba Inu is pushing updates around its Shibarium layer-2 solution, strengthening the coin’s utility and making it more than just a meme ticker. For community members, this signals long-term vision, where memes meet infrastructure. Its decentralized exchanges and staking pools keep liquidity flowing, ensuring Shiba Inu’s role isn’t sidelined by new projects. October finds Shiba Inu benefiting from renewed excitement in decentralized applications and cross-chain compatibility. The coin is leveraging its branding strength while offering serious tools for holders. Participants recognize that SHIB continues to balance meme culture with expanding utility, cementing its place as a project that stays relevant while many meme tokens burn out. 5. Pudgy Penguins March Into 2025 With Viral Momentum Pudgy Penguins has transformed from a quirky NFT collection into a cultural meme asset that carries real trading power. In 2025, it’s no longer just about cute artwork, but about a community-first token that thrives on cultural presence. October showcases Pudgy Penguins with new partnerships and global merchandise drops, reinforcing its branding both on-chain and off-chain. This evolution has kept it trending in markets where meme value and real-world recognition collide. Community enthusiasm fuels Pudgy Penguins’ strength. From viral Twitter campaigns to consistent secondary market activity, this project holds staying power that new entrants often fail to replicate. As 2025 unfolds, Pudgy Penguins proves that meme-driven tokens backed by strong identity and consistent innovation can command real attention, blending viral traction with long-term cultural positioning.

The projects highlighted for October—MoonBull, Dogecoin, BullZilla, Shiba Inu, and Pudgy Penguins—represent the mix of heritage, virality, and structured presale strength that defines Q4 2025. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to hold strong through history and ecosystem growth. BullZilla and Pudgy Penguins bring energy through community branding and cultural expansion. Yet MoonBull’s mechanics, from reflections to burns, from staking to governance, create a design that directly rewards those who step in early.

Participants chasing presale hype tokens with limited supply are recognizing that this isn’t just another ticker; it’s a community-first system engineered for sustainability. MoonBull’s early access rewards and smart mechanics ensure it doesn’t just ride a trend—it builds one.

        "body": "ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals XRP surging +3.78% to $2.9543 with strong bullish momentum as the Bank of Japan’s SBI announces an official XRP lending program for institutional payments, while Ripple CTO David Schwartz announces his exit from the company . At the same time, XRP shows exceptional technical strength, trading above all major EMAs, including the 20-day ( $2.5049 ), 50-day ( $2.9220 ), 100-day ( $2.8386 ), and 200-day ( $2.6160 ) support levels, positioning it for a potential $3.00 + breakthrough amid the October ETF decision timeline. ChatGPT’s XRP analysis synthesizes 23 + real-time technical indicators to assess XRP’s trajectory, while testing psychological $3.00 resistance with multiple ETF decisions pending. Technical Analysis: Strong Bullish Structure Above All EMAs XRP’s current price of $2.9543 reflects a robust +3.78% gain from the opening price of $2.8468 , establishing a volatile trading range between $2.9550 (high) and $2.8141 (low). This 4.8% intraday range demonstrates exceptional volatility typical of major institutional catalyst responses. Source: TradingView The RSI at 52.52 maintains neutral positioning, providing substantial room for upside continuation without overbought conditions. Moving averages reveal exceptional bullish positioning with XRP trading above all EMAs: 20-day at $2.5049 ( -15.2% ), 50-day at $2.9220 ( -1.1% ), 100-day at $2.8386 ( -3.9% ), and 200-day at $2.6160 ( -11.5% ). MACD also shows slight bearish positioning at -0.0012 just below zero with the signal line at -0.0266 , but a negative histogram at -0.0254 indicates improving momentum divergence. Source: TradingView Similarly, volume analysis shows exceptional activity at 97.71 million XRP, indicating massive institutional participation during the Bank of Japan announcement and CTO transition processing. The ATR maintains high readings at 2.5709 , suggesting continued volatility potential for moves toward psychological resistance levels. Market Context: Bank of Japan Integration Validates Institutional Utility XRP’s surge follows the Bank of Japan’s SBI announcement of an official XRP lending program , representing unprecedented institutional validation. Community analysis highlights “Bank of Japan (SBI) announces official $XRP lending program,” signaling “ Japan is preparing to utilize XRP for institutional payments at scale .” The Japanese institutional integration provides concrete utility validation beyond speculation, with XRP surpassing Bitcoin in trading volume on South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit, demonstrating accelerated Asian institutional demand. This geographic concentration suggests systematic regional adoption patterns. Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s transition to CTO Emeritus after 13 years marks a sign of institutional maturation rather than weakness. Community interpretation suggests “XRP is ready to run without him” as infrastructure development reaches the self-sustaining institutional adoption phase, requiring less founder dependency. Partnership expansion continues with Ondo Finance tokenizing U.S. treasuries on the XRP Ledger, while discussions on SWIFT integration persist despite recent Chainlink collaboration announcements. Horrendous week to be an $XRP holder. First, SWIFT announces that it's working with @chainlink and @Consensys on a blockchain-based ledger. Now, @Ripple 's CTO just quit earlier today. Can it get any worse than this for $XRP holders? pic.twitter.com/pR7ZrxMxiN — jfab.eth (@josefabregab) October 1, 2025 ETF Timeline Convergence Creates October Catalyst Framework October presents a massive convergence of catalysts with seven spot XRP ETF applications pending SEC decisions, beginning on October 18 . Applications from Grayscale, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton create an institutional infrastructure framework comparable to Bitcoin and Ethereum precedents. XRP ETF DECISIONS COMING THIS OCTOBER! There are 6 companies awaiting SEC decisions on $XRP ETFs starting from the 2nd week of October. pic.twitter.com/vXAEZwZHEY — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) September 30, 2025 Community sentiment emphasizes “ Uptober ” narrative with discussions of “ biggest month in XRP history ” as regulatory timeline convergence with technical positioning creates compelling setup. The 2017 pattern comparison gains traction with analysts noting “XRP bullish quarterly close above the resistance for the first time since 2017, ” suggesting historical parallel formation. The technical structure mirrors previous cycle accumulation patterns preceding major appreciation phases. Market Fundamentals: Exceptional Metrics Support Institutional Confidence XRP maintains substantial positioning with $175.35 billion market cap ( +3.49% ). The market cap growth accompanies increased volume at $6.48 billion ( +34.76% ), indicating active institutional repositioning. The 3.69% volume-to-market cap ratio suggests exceptional trading activity supporting price appreciation during catalyst events such as this. Source: CoinMarketCap Additionally, a market dominance of 4.41% ( -0.15% ) shows slight weakness relative to the broader market but maintains substantial altcoin leadership positioning. However, a fully diluted valuation of $293.71 billion reflects the total network value, including future releases, while the holder count of 476,250 shows both retail interest and institutional adoption. Social Sentiment: Institutional Confidence Amid Leadership Transition LunarCrush data reveals improving social performance with XRP’s AltRank at 253 ( +12 ) during institutional developments. Galaxy Score of 68 ( +23 ) reflects an exceptional sentiment surge as participants process Japanese banking integration and ETF timeline convergence. Engagement metrics show substantial increases with 20.07 million total engagements ( +1.44M ) and 65.3K mentions ( +27.66K ). Additionally, social dominance of 3.7% ( +1.5% ) shows exceptional growth, while sentiment registers at a robust 83% positive. Prominent analysts identify 2017 pattern similarities with some projecting “ $20 by December” targets while others emphasize near-term $3.15 breakout levels. Technical discussions center on quarterly close patterns and historical cycle comparisons, suggesting major appreciation potential. ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis: Institutional Infrastructure Meets Technical Breakout ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals XRP positioned for potential psychological $3.00 breakthrough following Japanese institutional program validation and leadership transition signs. Immediate resistance emerges at the psychological $3.00 level, followed by key resistance at $3.05 – $3.10 range. Breaking above these levels would signal institutional adoption validation, driving momentum toward $3.20 – $3.30 + targets based on previous resistance structures. Source: TradingView Support structure remains exceptional with 50-day EMA ( $2.9220 ) providing immediate downside protection, followed by layered support at 100-day ( $2.8386 ) and 200-day ( $2.6160 ) EMAs. The technical setup suggests bullish bias for catalyst-driven continuation with excellent risk-reward positioning. Three-Month XRP Price Forecast: ETF and Institutional Scenarios Institutional Breakthrough (55% Probability) Successful break above $3.00 combined with October ETF approvals could drive XRP toward $3.50 – $4.00 , representing 18 – 35% upside from current levels. Source: TradingView This scenario requires regulatory validation and Japanese program scaling confirmation. Consolidation Before Launch (30% Probability) Continued resistance testing could result in consolidation between $2.85 – $3.10 , allowing institutional program development while awaiting ETF decisions before the next major catalyst-driven move. Source: TradingView Correction Risk (15% Probability) Failure at $3.00 resistance could trigger selling toward $2.85 – $2.80 support levels, representing 3 – 6% downside. Source: TradingView Recovery would depend on ETF decision outcomes and Japanese program adoption metrics. ChatGPT’s XRP Analysis: Banking Integration Validates Payment Infrastructure ChatGPT’s XRP analysis reveals XRP at a key inflection point between Japanese institutional banking validation and psychological resistance breakthrough requirement. Next Price Target: $3.50-$4.00 Within 90 Days The immediate trajectory requires a decisive break above $3.00 psychological resistance to validate institutional banking integration momentum. From there, ETF approval acceleration could propel XRP toward $3.50 institutional target, with sustained Japanese program scaling driving toward $4.00 + breakout levels. However, failure to break $3.00 would indicate extended consolidation toward $2.85 – $2.90 range, creating a final accumulation opportunity before the next institutional wave drives XRP toward $5.00 + targets.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pi-network-price-prediction/",
        "body": "Key Takeaways: Pi price faces volatility around $0.27. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to increase to a maximum level of $0.3195 in 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.14. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social crypto and developer ecosystem built for real-world utility and mass accessibility. In 2025, Pi Network is entering a crucial stage, despite market sentiment remaining cautious; on-chain activity and ecosystem growth continue to develop. Notably, Pi recently recorded a new all-time low of $0.2234 on September 22, 2025, down sharply from its February peak of $2.98, underscoring the token’s high volatility in the crypto market. Despite this, key fundamental factors are keeping investor interest alive. The Passkey Update introduced stronger wallet security through Face ID, fingerprint, and PIN authentication ahead of the long-awaited Mainnet launch. Meanwhile, the Pi Hackathon 2025 has reached its halfway point, with developers showcasing projects that could expand the Pi ecosystem. At the same time, Pi has drawn attention from a partnership with Sign Protocol, backed by Binance’s venture arm, fueling speculation of a potential Binance listing. Adding to the momentum, co-founder Chengdiao Fan is scheduled to deliver a keynote at TOKEN2049 in Singapore, a high-profile event expected to influence investor confidence. In this article on Pi Network price prediction, we analyze recent technical factors and fundamental developments, including price history, key support levels, resistance levels, and multiple technical quantitative indicators, to assess whether Pi’s current forecast points to recovery or further decline between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.2718 Price Change 24h 4.59% Market Cap $2.24B Circulating Supply 8.24B PI Trading Volume 24h $42.55M All-Time High $2.98, Feb 26, 2025 All-Time Low $0.2234, Sep 22, 2025 Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.2718 Price Prediction $ 0.20109 (-24.94%) Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 11.19% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.346655 200-Day SMA No Data 14-Day RSI 26.14 Pi Price Analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Pi Network price trades at $0.2718, up 2.80% in the past 24 hours. Pi shows signs of short-term recovery, but momentum remains weak. Resistance stands at $0.28–$0.30, while support holds near $0.26–$0.25. On October 1, 2025, Pi Network price analysis shows a bullish recovery, with PI trading at $0.2718, up 2.80% from the last 24-hour close at $0.2644. The rebound signals improving market sentiment after recent weakness, as buyers pushed the price higher in the day session. Pi now faces resistance near $0.30–$0.32, where selling pressure is expected to intensify unless momentum strengthens further. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 24-hour chart shows that Pi is trading at $0.2718, posting a 2.80% gain in the last 24 hours. The recovery comes after a recent downtrend, but the market still trades below the key $0.30 resistance zone, keeping sentiment cautious. The RSI is at 37.56 (average line at 37.44), which is still in bearish territory below 50, indicating that Pi remains close to oversold conditions but with a slight improvement in momentum. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD line is –0.0285, just above the signal line at –0.0315, with a small green histogram of 0.0030. This indicates bearish momentum is fading, and a moderate bullish crossover may be developing. This suggests that bearish momentum is fading, though buyers are not yet strong enough to confirm a strong reversal. Immediate resistance is now seen at $0.30–$0.32, while support holds near $0.25–$0.26. A move above $0.28 would improve the short-term outlook, but failure to sustain above current levels could invite another retest of support. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour chart, Pi is trading at $0.2716, down 0.88% in the latest session. Price action reflects weakness as sellers keep pushing below $0.28.The RSI stands at 47.94, with the average line at 52.97. This is just below the neutral 50 level, showing fading momentum and a tilt toward bearish sentiment. The MACD line is at 0.0008, equal to the signal line at 0.0008, while the histogram is slightly negative at –0.0001. This reflects a flat trend with no clear momentum, signaling indecision in the market. Immediate resistance is seen near $0.28–$0.30, while support remains strong at $0.26. A breakdown below $0.26 could expose $0.22, but if Pi can regain $0.28, it may retest the $0.30 zone. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.312614 SELL SMA 5 $0.285427 SELL SMA 10 $0.283233 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.324889 SELL SMA 50 $0.346655 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.405425 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.317388 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.330373 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.342745 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.35607 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.39583 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.482022 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi price is likely to stay in consolidation, with resistance at $0.28–$0.30 and support around $0.26–$0.22. A move above $0.28 could signal short-term bullish momentum, while a drop below $0.26 may trigger further downside. Confirmation of trend direction will depend on RSI breaking above 50 or a stronger MACD crossover. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price up today? Pi is up today mainly due to whale accumulation, with a single wallet buying over 331 million PI (~$148.5) since May, reducing sell pressure. Optimism is also supported by anticipation of the 2025 Open Network update, which could improve utility and liquidity. Short-term technical indicators show a bullish rebound above key moving averages, adding momentum to the rally. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and continuous token unlocks, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value. Recent Pi News/Opinions Pi Network co-founder Dr. Chengdiao Fan is set to deliver a keynote address at TOKEN2049 Singapore, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency conferences. The session is expected to highlight Pi Network’s vision for Web3 adoption, exploring how blockchain can transition from speculative trading to real-world use cases.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History: Coinmarketcap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation.
