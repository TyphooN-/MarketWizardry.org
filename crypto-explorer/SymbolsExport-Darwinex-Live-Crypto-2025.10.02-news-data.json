        "title": "Pundit’s ‘Outrageous’ $170,000 Target For XRP Price Draws Attention, Says Don’t Use ‘Old World’ Math",
        "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/outrageous-170000-target-for-xrp/",
        "body": "The XRP price has often drawn ambitious forecasts, but few as outrageous as a recent prediction placing its potential value at $170,000 per token. This projection not only suggests that XRP could surpass the current price of its primary rival, Ethereum, but even dethrone Bitcoin, which has an ATH above $124,000. The crypto analyst behind this bold claim openly rejects conventional valuation models, arguing that they belong to the “old world” and are incapable of measuring the disruptive potential of blockchain-based assets. Why A $170,000 XRP Price Isn’t “Impossible” XRP long-term price forecasts continue to grow bolder as the market evolves, with the latest prediction by crypto analyst ‘XRP Dragon,’ suggesting that reaching $170,000 is not only possible, but inevitable. The analyst argued that the reason many dismiss such a target is due to an insistence on applying “old world math” to an emerging digital economy that operates under different principles. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Definitely Reach $10,000, Gives Reasons Why To illustrate this distinct perspective, the analyst shared a video alongside his analysis on X social media, featuring a woman who explained the reasoning behind his bold $170,000 forecast. She likened the misconceptions surrounding XRP’s price potential to how people viewed the internet in its early days. She explained that back in 1995, it would have made no sense to measure the transformative power of the internet through an outdated tool like the phone book. This is because, at the time, the internet was creating an entirely “new world” that the phone book could not capture. She argues that a similar shift is occurring with money today. Many still rely on old-world concepts, such as market capitalization, a measure that works in the old paper system. However, this obsolete system is falling apart as the world transitions into a new era of digital money. According to her, using outdated calculations like market cap to define XRP’s potential value is akin to trying to fit a revolutionary new technology into a framework designed for the past. Related Reading: Analyst Highlights 2 Scenarios That Sends XRP Price To $9.6 And $33 She further added that the foundation of global finance is shifting rapidly as banks, countries, and eventually trillions of dollars transition onto digital rails. Within this system, XRP is designed to serve as the connecting bridge that enables value to flow between institutions and across borders. From this perspective, the $170,000 XRP price projection is not an impossible or unrealistic target but an “inevitable” outcome, if the asset is measured according to the digital system it was created for. XRP Repeats 2017 Bull Run Pattern New technical analysis further reveals that XRP is showing signs of repeating its historic 2017 bull cycle. According to crypto analyst EtherNasyonal, back then, XRP followed a precise sequence of accumulation, rally, re-accumulation, and then another explosive move upward before entering distribution. The analyst’s chart shows that XRP is mirroring the exact pattern seen during the 2017 bull run. Already, XRP has passed through its accumulation and initial breakout phase, now sitting in a consolidation zone. If price action repeats past patterns exactly, another strong move higher could emerge in 2025. EtherNasyonal predicts a potential price surge toward $10 before the distribution phase kicks in.

Analysts now target $6,400 with multi-year projections between $7,000–$12,000, citing accumulation and macro adoption drivers. Strongest quarterly candle: ETH closed above $4,000, flipping resistance into support. On-chain withdrawals of ~420,000 ETH reduced exchange balances, indicating accumulation. Analysts project targets from $6,400 to $12,000 for 2025, with extensions toward $15,000 noted by some forecasters. Ethereum breakout: ETH posts strongest quarterly close above $4,000; read expert targets and on-chain signals. View market levels, support and next steps. What is driving the Ethereum breakout above $4,000? Ethereum breakout was driven by a historic quarterly close that turned $4,000 resistance into support, combined with major on-chain withdrawals and renewed demand from institutional and retail buyers. Short-term momentum, reduced exchange supply, and bullish market structure supported upside projections. Ethereum records its strongest quarterly close above $4,000 with $6,400 in sight as analysts project $7K–$12K targets for 2025. Ethereum posts strongest quarterly candle, breaking $4,000 resistance with $6,400 target in sight. On-chain data shows 420,000 ETH withdrawn, reducing exchange supply and signaling strong accumulation. Analysts project Ethereum could reach $7,000–$12,000 in 2025, with possible extension toward $15,000. Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum after recording its most powerful quarterly candle on record. ETH broke above long-standing resistance and secured the highest quarterly close in history. Analysts and on-chain metrics indicate important upside targets and supportive fundamentals. How did Ethereum break resistance with the strongest quarterly close? Technical analysis shows repeated failures at $4,000 between 2022 and 2025 before a confirmed breakout. The breakout candle established new market structure and turned resistance into support, adding momentum to Ethereum’s upward trajectory. According to analysis prepared by Titan of Crypto, the quarterly consolidation ended with a decisive close that validated higher highs and higher lows since early 2023. That structure fueled short-term targets while reinforcing longer-term bullish scenarios. #Ethereum is Insanely Bullish Right Now #ETH just broke out with its strongest quarterly candle ever. Target could be $6,400. pic.twitter.com/cvOMiTFCT9 — Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) October 1, 2025 Chart projections highlighted an initial upside objective near $6,400, with additional longer-range projections toward $6,800 and above. Market structure confirmed sustained buying pressure and higher demand throughout recent quarters. Source: CoinMarketCap Each quarterly candle reinforced the bullish structure and placed Ethereum within reach of higher targets. At the time of this report ETH traded at $4,392.51 with a daily gain of 1.81% and a market capitalization of $530.19 billion. Daily trading volume measured $45.56 billion, up 5.51%. Why are on-chain withdrawals significant for price momentum? On-chain metrics showed roughly 420,000 ETH withdrawn from exchange wallets, sending exchange balances to nine-year lows. This reduction in available supply typically lowers selling pressure and signals accumulation by larger holders. Withdrawal data (source: Coinglass, presented as plain text) suggests a tightening supply-demand dynamic. Lower exchange balances historically correlate with improved price resilience during bullish runs. Market Activity and Expert Predictions At Korea Blockchain Week 2025, Tom Lee (FundStrat) projected that Ethereum could reach $7,000–$12,000 by year-end, with a possible extension toward $15,000 within a new multi-year cycle. He cited artificial intelligence and finance as structural demand drivers. Source: MichaelvandePoppe(X) Analyst Michael van de Poppe noted that Ethereum has been holding up well versus Bitcoin, pointing to continued momentum. ETH/BTC displayed a 144.27% rise since May 2025 before a retracement to 0.03664, with clear buying zones identified. What are the immediate technical levels to watch? Immediate support sits near $4,300. Key upside objectives include $4,406 and $4,565 followed by projection targets at $6,400 and higher. Traders should monitor exchange balances, liquidity zones, and quarter-over-quarter market structure for confirmation.

About 420,000 ETH were withdrawn, pushing exchange balances to nine-year lows. This matters because lower exchange supply reduces potential selling pressure and often correlates with stronger price support. Will analyst targets guarantee price movement to $7,000–$12,000? Analyst targets reflect scenarios based on current momentum and macro themes; they are not guarantees. These projections incorporate technical structure, on-chain flows, and macro adoption indicators. Key Takeaways Breakout confirmed : Ethereum closed the quarter above $4,000, converting resistance into support. On-chain accumulation : ~420,000 ETH withdrawn from exchanges signals lower sell pressure. Analyst outlook : Targets range from $6,400 near-term to $7K–$12K for 2025, with some extensions toward $15K; monitor support and exchange flows. Conclusion This report shows Ethereum in a strong bullish phase after the highest quarterly close in history, supported by significant on-chain withdrawals and bullish market structure. Watch $4,300 as immediate support and aggregate analyst targets for longer-term planning.

        "body": "On-chain analysis platform Glassnode stated in its latest report that the Bitcoin (BTC) market has rebalanced following the historic large option expirations and is preparing for the next directional move. According to the report, Bitcoin has maintained a strong hold above its “short-term investor cost floor” since May 2025. This level serves as a critical threshold between a continuation of the bull market and potential bearish scenarios. However, analysts believe the price is facing strong resistance in a region of concentrated supply. The easing of selling pressure from long-term investors and the resumption of ETF inflows indicate a stabilization of the demand side of the market. However, the Fear and Greed Index and the RVT indicator reveal that the market has retreated from “excessive greed” to “neutral and fear” levels. This reflects investors' focus on profit-taking and a decline in risk appetite. Related News: How High Could Bitcoin Go in October? Here's the Forecast Based on Historical Data In the options market, following last week's record expiration, open interest has begun to reshape. This development eliminates hedge-driven volatility and allows new positions to drive price movements. While volatility has decreased, the curve structure maintains its contango appearance. While front-end volatility has weakened, the long-term outlook remains strong in the 39-43% range. While fund flows indicate moderate upward interest, traders are maintaining cautious optimism through risk-reversal strategies and option combinations. The balance of dealer gamma positions is dampening sudden volatility driven by hedges. As a result, Glassnode argued that the market is currently on a more neutral and constructive footing, but that decisive signs for the next strong directional move have not yet emerged. *This is not investment advice.

        "title": "Ethereum Sharp Exchange Outflows Sparks A Historic Supply Squeeze, Here’s What It Means",
        "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-sharp-exchange-outflows/",
        "body": "In a sudden upside move, Ethereum has strongly reclaimed above the $4,300 price mark as bullish sentiment gradually returns to the crypto market. At the same time, a massive amount of ETH has been observed leaving centralized crypto exchanges, which has led to one of the most crucial moments for the leading altcoin in the ongoing bull market cycle. Unprecedented Supply Shock For Ethereum Looms With the price of Ethereum recovering sharply once again, the bullish sentiment and action of investors on crypto exchanges have intensified. Alphractal, an advanced investment and on-chain data analytics platform, revealed that Ethereum is undergoing one of its most dramatic supply movements to date, as large quantities of ETH continue to flee centralized exchanges at an accelerating pace. According to the on-chain platform, the persistent withdrawal of ETH has created a historic supply squeeze. This is due to the fact that the quantity of ETH leaving crypto exchanges is now above the ability to accumulate more for the first time in history. The record-breaking supply squeeze demonstrates an increasing tendency among investors to prioritize long-term holding and staking over active trading. As a result, there is a decrease in the available liquidity in the market. In recent months, the data shows that billions of dollars worth of ETH have been withdrawn from crypto exchanges, regardless of whether you look at Netflow in ETH or USD value. Despite the massive withdrawal, Alphractal highlighted that the Exchange Flux Balance is what truly sticks out. The Exchange Flux Balance is a crucial metric that gauges the cumulative net flow of exchanges. It is worth noting that high values on this metric suggest that inflows are outperforming outflows and that exchanges are increasing their reserves. Meanwhile, low or negative values indicate that exchanges do not have the capacity to accumulate enough, hence creating a supply squeeze. Currently, this metric has gone negative for the first time ever, indicating strong institutional and public demand for ETH . Simply put, Ethereum is experiencing the strongest market maker interest since its launch, a structure that might flare up the market soon. ETH Closed Q3 On A Very Bullish Note As Q4 of 2025 kicks off, speculations are whether this quarter will be just as bullish as the recently finished Q3. Data from leading crypto researcher and analytics platform CryptoRank reveals that ETH experienced a very positive Q3, recording about 66.7% price gain. According to the platform, Q3 of 2025 was a breakout quarter for the altcoin, as it finally broke past its previous all-time high and exhibited strong upside action. One of the major factors that fueled this surge is the US legislative moves, which consistently pushed stablecoins and DeFi into the mainstream. Naturally, Ethereum became one of the major beneficiaries of this regulation change because the leading blockchain continues to be the foundation layer for both stablecoins and DeFi activity. With ETH witnessing a more bullish Q4 in the last 10 years, it is possible that this quarter could end on a positive note.",

        "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/outrageous-170000-target-for-xrp/",
        "body": "The XRP price has often drawn ambitious forecasts, but few as outrageous as a recent prediction placing its potential value at $170,000 per token. This projection not only suggests that XRP could surpass the current price of its primary rival, Ethereum, but even dethrone Bitcoin, which has an ATH above $124,000. The crypto analyst behind this bold claim openly rejects conventional valuation models, arguing that they belong to the “old world” and are incapable of measuring the disruptive potential of blockchain-based assets. Why A $170,000 XRP Price Isn’t “Impossible” XRP long-term price forecasts continue to grow bolder as the market evolves, with the latest prediction by crypto analyst ‘XRP Dragon,’ suggesting that reaching $170,000 is not only possible, but inevitable. The analyst argued that the reason many dismiss such a target is due to an insistence on applying “old world math” to an emerging digital economy that operates under different principles. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Definitely Reach $10,000, Gives Reasons Why To illustrate this distinct perspective, the analyst shared a video alongside his analysis on X social media, featuring a woman who explained the reasoning behind his bold $170,000 forecast. She likened the misconceptions surrounding XRP’s price potential to how people viewed the internet in its early days. She explained that back in 1995, it would have made no sense to measure the transformative power of the internet through an outdated tool like the phone book. This is because, at the time, the internet was creating an entirely “new world” that the phone book could not capture. She argues that a similar shift is occurring with money today. Many still rely on old-world concepts, such as market capitalization, a measure that works in the old paper system. However, this obsolete system is falling apart as the world transitions into a new era of digital money. According to her, using outdated calculations like market cap to define XRP’s potential value is akin to trying to fit a revolutionary new technology into a framework designed for the past. Related Reading: Analyst Highlights 2 Scenarios That Sends XRP Price To $9.6 And $33 She further added that the foundation of global finance is shifting rapidly as banks, countries, and eventually trillions of dollars transition onto digital rails. Within this system, XRP is designed to serve as the connecting bridge that enables value to flow between institutions and across borders. From this perspective, the $170,000 XRP price projection is not an impossible or unrealistic target but an “inevitable” outcome, if the asset is measured according to the digital system it was created for. XRP Repeats 2017 Bull Run Pattern New technical analysis further reveals that XRP is showing signs of repeating its historic 2017 bull cycle. According to crypto analyst EtherNasyonal, back then, XRP followed a precise sequence of accumulation, rally, re-accumulation, and then another explosive move upward before entering distribution. The analyst’s chart shows that XRP is mirroring the exact pattern seen during the 2017 bull run. Already, XRP has passed through its accumulation and initial breakout phase, now sitting in a consolidation zone. If price action repeats past patterns exactly, another strong move higher could emerge in 2025. EtherNasyonal predicts a potential price surge toward $10 before the distribution phase kicks in.

        "body": "XRP price is testing the $3.00 resistance after a 4% intraday rise and a 9% monthly gain; technicals show a compressing market with weak ADX (14) and neutral RSI (57), so a confirmed breakout requires daily closes above $3.10 with rising ADX.

(150-160 chars) What is happening with the XRP price now? XRP price has rallied about 4% today to test the $3.00 level after a 9% rise over 30 days, but technical indicators show a compressing market. Short-term momentum is weak (ADX 14), so bulls need clear confirmation to claim a sustained breakout. How does technical analysis shape the outlook for XRP? Price action shows XRP trapped in a horizontal channel within a descending triangle since July highs near $3.80. The 50-day EMA sits at ~ $3.00 and acts as immediate resistance, while the 200-day EMA near $2.70 serves as stronger support. Traders must watch EMA confluence and ADX for trend validation. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"XRP Price Tests $3.00 as Traders Turn Cautiously Bullish\", \"image\": [\"https://en.coinotag.com/images/xrp-chart.jpg\"], \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-02T08:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-02T12:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/images/logo.png\" } }, \"description\": \"XRP price is testing $3.00 after a 4% intraday gain; technicals show a compressing market with weak ADX, while prediction market odds lean slightly bullish.\"} Why are prediction markets and traders mixed on XRP? Myriad prediction markets shifted sentiment to a 55% chance of XRP reaching $4 before dropping to $2, reversing last week’s odds. This signals increased upside conviction but not broad consensus. Market participants cite upcoming CME derivatives activity and institutional interest as drivers. What do momentum indicators indicate for XRP? ADX at 14 signals low trend strength and a risk of false breakouts. RSI at 57 is neutral, not warning of immediate exhaustion. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator reads “on,” implying compression ahead of a decisive move; without rising ADX, that move could be either direction.

Use tight risk management and avoid heavy leverage near $3. Set stop-loss orders below $2.95 and scale entries toward $2.70 support. Wait for confirmation: multiple daily closes above $3.10 and a rising ADX are the clearest signals of trend resumption. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to trade XRP around $3.00 resistance\", \"description\": \"Step-by-step approach to trading XRP while it tests the $3.00 resistance level.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Confirm momentum\", \"text\": \"Wait for ADX to rise above 25 and daily closes above $3.10 before increasing position size.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Manage risk\", \"text\": \"Set stop-losses below $2.95 and avoid excessive leverage that risks liquidation near the $3.00 level.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Scale entries\", \"text\": \"Enter in small increments with additional buys toward $2.70 support if price pulls back.\" } ]} Key Takeaways Momentum is weak : ADX at 14 warns that today’s move may be a false breakout. EMA structure favors bulls long-term : 50-day EMA near $3.00 vs 200-day EMA near $2.70. Trade with confirmation : Look for daily closes above $3.10 and rising ADX before adding risk. Conclusion XRP price is showing renewed upside but remains inside a compression pattern that demands caution. Prediction market sentiment is slightly bullish and EMAs keep the longer-term structure intact, yet weak ADX and neutral RSI require confirmatory price action. Monitor daily closes above $3.10 and ADX momentum before increasing exposure; COINOTAG will update as conditions evolve.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/which-defi-altcoin-will-deliver-50x-gains-by-2026-mutuum-finance-mutm-or-cardano-ada/",
        "body": "With the clock ticking on 2026, investors are pinpointing which DeFi altcoin will provide the type of blistering returns that characterize bull runs and the battle between Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Cardano (ADA) is getting hot. Cardano, one of the leading smart contract platforms of its time, continues innovating with fresh upgrades that it hopes will facilitate better scalability and growth in its DeFi ecosystem. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming the clear victor. Sold for just $0.035 during presale, Mutuum Finance is constructed on a dual lending economy, real-yield tokenomics, and a non-custodial smart contract infrastructure that provides much higher flexibility and utility than traditional DeFi networks. With more than 16,700 owners, over $16.7 million raised in its presale, the project is now regarded as the most asymmetrically promising DeFi project. Mutuum Finance could 50x by 2026 and perhaps be the most promising Cardano alternative in the next market cycle. Cardano (ADA) Hits Pivotal Crossroads as Consolidation Drags In Cardano (ADA) has spent most of 2025 stuck in a maddening mode of consolidation, repeatedly failing to break the all-critical $1.20 resistance level even after several attempts throughout the year. Now trading in a narrow range of $0.7574 and $0.8156 after breaking below critical support, ADA appears to be hitting its tipping point. Technical charts confirm this tension building: Bollinger Bands have the price just a hair above the lower band, usually a signal of oversold levels, and the RSI reading of 43.6 says that sentiment remains neutral and could turn either direction. Experts warn that failure at $0.7574 can trigger a spasm lower, and a big breakout over $0.8156 can bring about a recovery to $1.20. As investors hold their breath for ADA’s next breakthrough, investors are also looking towards new trends in the DeFi segment, with increasing interest in trailblazing project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) showing where money might go next. MUTM Presale Momentum Picks Up Pace MUTM tokens currently sell at $0.035 in Presale Round 6, an increase of 16.17% from the previous round. Investor demand remains very high with over 16,700 investors sending over $16.7 million so far. As a further step towards enhancing platform security, Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, and white-hat hackers and developers can report bugs. Four levels of bug severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, are available so that problems could be detected and resolved early. The protocol is built on strong collateral management to protect both the participants and the network. Unlimited collateral ratios, lending limits, and deposit limits are some of the characteristics that make it safe. Real-time closing of undercollateral positions and remediation penalties and fees stabilize the platform and reduce systemic risk. Efficiency is at the heart of Mutuum Finance’s architecture. Through the optimization of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and the taking of overcollateralized positions, the protocol engages the highest possible amount of capital with robust guards. Reserve requirements serve to act as a shock absorber to market volatilities, with overlying reserves able to be leveraged in higher-risk assets in order to hedge volatility. Mutuum Finance is reshaping decentralized finance along three central axes: long-term sustainability, trust, and usability. Its secure, scalable lending and borrowing platform is taking DeFi to retail and institutional investors. As a gesture to its growing community, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway wherein 10 winners will each be given $10,000 in MUTM tokens. The gesture reflects the platform’s readiness to reward early adopters, as well as make the vision of the project more prominent. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is raising over $16.7 million from 16,700+ wallets, and over 55% of Phase 6 presale is sold at $0.035. As Cardano (ADA) struggles, MUTM offers high-upside potential with its dual lending economy, safe smart contracts, and robust risk management. A $50,000 CertiK bug bounty and $100,000 giveaway bonus reward early adopters. Acquire MUTM tokens before presale ends.

        "body": "Summary XRP traded at $2.96 after rebounding from the $2.84 to $2.85 support cluster near the 100-day EMA. Derivatives activity rose, with futures volume up 35% to $6.7 billion and open interest at $7.87 billion. Net inflows of $10.38 million on Oct. 2 signaled fresh spot demand as funding stayed modestly positive. By Jainam Mehta XRP ( XRP-USD ) traded near $2.96 on Thursday as the market tried to reclaim momentum following weeks of compression inside a descending setup. Buyers again defended the $2.84 to $2.85 area, where horizontal demand aligns with the 100-day exponential moving average. XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView) That zone has absorbed multiple selloffs since mid-August and remains a primary line of defense. Momentum has begun to stabilize. The Relative Strength Index rose to 53 and crossed above its signal, pointing to improving short-term strength without overbought conditions. The 20-day EMA at $2.91 flipped back into play as intraday support, and price is now testing the upper boundary of the pattern. A daily close above $3.00 to $3.05 would be the first constructive step toward reversing the broader downtrend and would shift focus to higher resistance zones. On the topside, successive ceilings sit at $3.05 to $3.10, followed by $3.25 and $3.45. A stronger run could put $3.60 on the radar if momentum accelerates. On the downside, a return to $2.84 to $2.85 would test the durability of the base. A decisive failure there would expose $2.62 at the 200-day EMA. Futures and options show renewed appetite Derivatives positioning strengthened alongside price. Aggregate futures trading volume jumped 35 percent to $6.7 billion. Open interest increased nearly 6 percent to $7.87 billion, a sign that fresh capital is entering the market rather than only rotating within existing positions. Options activity surged as well. Total options volume rose 52 percent, while options open interest fell 36 percent. The combination implies that traders added near-term exposure but trimmed hedges, a setup that can magnify follow-through if price clears nearby resistance. Long and short ratios on major venues tilted bullish. Binance accounts showed a 3.28 ratio in favor of longs, while top trader positioning skewed above 2.6. Liquidation data pointed to heavier losses for shorts, suggesting pressure could intensify if price pushes through the $3 handle. Funding rates stayed slightly positive across major futures venues. The absence of extreme funding reduces the risk of a sudden squeeze in either direction and supports a more orderly advance if spot demand persists. Spot flows turn positive as accumulation resurfaces On-chain and exchange flows added to the constructive tone. On Oct. 2, XRP recorded net inflows of $10.38 million, coinciding with the push toward $2.97. The figure contrasts with the outflow pattern that dominated prior weeks and implies that some traders are shifting from defense to accumulation near the established base. One session does not set a lasting trend, but the turn in flows is consistent with improving technical conditions above the 20-day EMA. Market structure remains sensitive to headlines and broad risk appetite. Even so, the alignment of rising futures interest, firmer spot flows, and a defended 100-day EMA gives bulls a clearer path, provided price can establish acceptance above $3.00. XRP short-term outlook XRP’s near-term path hinges on the $3.00 to $3.05 zone. A close above that band would confirm a break of descending supply and open room toward $3.25, then $3.45. If momentum extends, $3.60 becomes a stretch target. Failure to clear $3.05 risks a return to $2.84 to $2.85, with a deeper test toward $2.62 if the base gives way. Previously, we noted that XRP’s triangle compression and persistent exchange outflows kept rallies capped near $3.00. The recent combination of net inflows, stronger futures participation, and a rebound off the 100-day EMA suggests that dynamic is beginning to shift. Bulls still need confirmation through a clean break of resistance, but the balance of forces is more supportive than it was in September.

Moonbirds BIRB token is an announced ecosystem token for the Moonbirds NFT collection, planned to launch on Solana to add utility and liquidity to the project. The announcement prompted renewed market interest and a short-term rise in Moonbirds secondary sales and floor price. How will launching on Solana affect Moonbirds? Launching BIRB on Solana may provide lower transaction costs and access to a large meme-coin ecosystem, increasing token tradability. Market reaction was immediate: secondary sales spiked, briefly pushing the floor near 4 ETH before leveling at ~3.45 ETH (about $15,450 at time of reporting). Why is community history relevant to this move?

        "body": "The crypto market is entering October on firmer footing after a turbulent September, with analysts now spotlighting coins that could set the tone for the final quarter of the year. While Bitcoin steadies around $113,000, attention has shifted to select altcoins that appear positioned for stronger upside. Among the top mentions are XRP, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE – three assets that appeal to very different types of investors but share one common theme: momentum. With Uptober historically a bullish month for digital assets, experts argue that this mix of established leaders and emerging contenders could outperform as capital rotates back into crypto. Why XRP is back on investor radars XRP has managed to do what many tokens couldn’t in the past few months – maintain stability while sentiment across the market swung wildly. Trading near $2.90, it has quietly become a favorite for institutional traders who value its resilience. Analysts suggest that XRP’s liquidity, coupled with renewed interest from payment-focused firms, makes it an attractive hold through October. Unlike speculative meme coins, XRP’s appeal lies in its adoption story. Several payment corridors continue to test and expand XRP-based solutions, and this steady progress adds to the sense that the token has room to climb even without hype-driven rallies. Solana’s network dominance expands Solana’s rise has been one of the biggest stories of 2025. Consistently holding above $210, SOL has cemented itself as more than just an “Ethereum alternative.” The blockchain has become the go-to platform for developers launching fast, scalable applications, from DeFi to gaming. In October, traders are especially watching how Solana responds to increased activity from institutional players. Its low fees and quick finality are attractive to large investors seeking efficient settlement layers. Analysts argue that if Bitcoin remains stable, Solana could easily outperform many peers during Uptober. MAGACOIN FINANCE: safety as a selling point For risk-tolerant investors, presale tokens are often about speed and hype – but MAGACOIN FINANCE has flipped the script by making security its strongest selling point. The project has already passed comprehensive audits from HashEx and CertiK, two of the industry’s most trusted firms. This focus on safety has drawn in thousands of retail investors who want early-stage exposure without the usual uncertainty of unverified projects. Analysts believe that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s combination of transparency, community growth, and audit-backed credibility could make it one of the standout performers of October. Unlike XRP and Solana, which already have multi-billion-dollar valuations, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers room for exponential growth if its momentum continues. Different profiles, same destination What makes these three picks compelling is how different they are. XRP is the regulated, adoption-driven token that institutions can get behind. Solana is the high-performance ecosystem that continues to lead innovation in the layer-1 space. MAGACOIN FINANCE, meanwhile, is the upstart presale offering investors a chance at exponential returns with the reassurance of security audits. Analysts say this combination reflects how investor strategies are evolving: balancing safer, large-cap plays with early-stage tokens that could generate multiples. Uptober, with its track record of market rallies, provides the perfect backdrop for such a diversified approach. Conclusion October 2025 is shaping up to be another defining month for crypto markets. XRP’s quiet stability near $2.90, Solana’s stronghold above $210, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s growing reputation as the most secure presale on the market are giving investors plenty of options. Whether through institutional adoption, network innovation, or early-stage growth stories, these three tokens represent some of the most compelling opportunities for Uptober.

        "body": "XRP is approaching a defining moment . Price action has tightened near a crucial resistance zone, and momentum is building in a way that could soon reshape the token’s short-term outlook. Traders and long-term holders are paying close attention, as a respected market analyst has issued a clear signal that could set the stage for the next major move. The latest alert comes from STEPH IS CRYPTO, who shared a detailed analysis on X using the three-daily timeframe. Steph explained, “We are on the verge of a huge breakout,” noting that confirmation requires a decisive daily close above roughly $3. He added, “$2.95 maybe, but $3 to be safe.” According to him, this level is the key trigger that would shift XRP’s technical structure from prolonged consolidation to a breakout phase. MAJOR #XRP ALERT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/iBGRVPp1Fp — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 2, 2025 Technical Outlook: The Breakout Roadmap Steph emphasized that XRP has been trapped in a corrective range since mid-July but is now “kissing the resistance.” If a breakout occurs, he highlighted a series of upside price levels: “The first major target is $3.60 , then we have four dollars, which is also a psychological level, and if we go higher than that, we have 4.63, above 5.” These incremental targets provide a roadmap for traders, marking where XRP may encounter resistance and where profit-taking becomes prudent. Risk Management and Profit Strategy Despite the bullish tone, Steph cautioned against blind optimism. “Make sure to secure these profits on the way up because typically rallies in crypto are very, very short-lived,” he advised. Rather than waiting for a single price objective, he encouraged holders to lock in gains gradually as XRP moves higher. His message is clear: successful trading is about protecting profits, not simply chasing lofty targets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Seasonal Tailwinds: Why Timing Matters Beyond the chart, Steph drew attention to seasonal market behavior, stressing that fear-driven exits could be premature. “This is not the time to be fearful, because historically Q4 always tends to be the best quarter for crypto ,” he said. This historical trend gives additional weight to the breakout scenario, suggesting that broader market conditions may align with the technical setup in favor of XRP. What Holders Should Take Away Steph’s alert is both a warning and an opportunity. Traders should confirm the breakout with their own charts, watch for strong volume to validate the move, and use the cited price levels as strategic checkpoints for profit-taking. His repeated reminder—“lock in the profits on the way up, secure your profits, guys”—underscores the importance of discipline in navigating volatile crypto rallies. The message is straightforward: a confirmed daily close above $3 could unlock the next leg higher for XRP, with price targets ranging from $3.60 to beyond $5. Steph’s analysis offers holders a structured plan—stay patient, wait for confirmation, and manage profits wisely. For XRP investors, this may be the alert that sets the tone for the final quarter of the year. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

        "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/outrageous-170000-target-for-xrp/",
        "body": "The XRP price has often drawn ambitious forecasts, but few as outrageous as a recent prediction placing its potential value at $170,000 per token. This projection not only suggests that XRP could surpass the current price of its primary rival, Ethereum, but even dethrone Bitcoin, which has an ATH above $124,000. The crypto analyst behind this bold claim openly rejects conventional valuation models, arguing that they belong to the “old world” and are incapable of measuring the disruptive potential of blockchain-based assets. Why A $170,000 XRP Price Isn’t “Impossible” XRP long-term price forecasts continue to grow bolder as the market evolves, with the latest prediction by crypto analyst ‘XRP Dragon,’ suggesting that reaching $170,000 is not only possible, but inevitable. The analyst argued that the reason many dismiss such a target is due to an insistence on applying “old world math” to an emerging digital economy that operates under different principles. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Definitely Reach $10,000, Gives Reasons Why To illustrate this distinct perspective, the analyst shared a video alongside his analysis on X social media, featuring a woman who explained the reasoning behind his bold $170,000 forecast. She likened the misconceptions surrounding XRP’s price potential to how people viewed the internet in its early days. She explained that back in 1995, it would have made no sense to measure the transformative power of the internet through an outdated tool like the phone book. This is because, at the time, the internet was creating an entirely “new world” that the phone book could not capture. She argues that a similar shift is occurring with money today. Many still rely on old-world concepts, such as market capitalization, a measure that works in the old paper system. However, this obsolete system is falling apart as the world transitions into a new era of digital money. According to her, using outdated calculations like market cap to define XRP’s potential value is akin to trying to fit a revolutionary new technology into a framework designed for the past. Related Reading: Analyst Highlights 2 Scenarios That Sends XRP Price To $9.6 And $33 She further added that the foundation of global finance is shifting rapidly as banks, countries, and eventually trillions of dollars transition onto digital rails. Within this system, XRP is designed to serve as the connecting bridge that enables value to flow between institutions and across borders. From this perspective, the $170,000 XRP price projection is not an impossible or unrealistic target but an “inevitable” outcome, if the asset is measured according to the digital system it was created for. XRP Repeats 2017 Bull Run Pattern New technical analysis further reveals that XRP is showing signs of repeating its historic 2017 bull cycle. According to crypto analyst EtherNasyonal, back then, XRP followed a precise sequence of accumulation, rally, re-accumulation, and then another explosive move upward before entering distribution. The analyst’s chart shows that XRP is mirroring the exact pattern seen during the 2017 bull run. Already, XRP has passed through its accumulation and initial breakout phase, now sitting in a consolidation zone. If price action repeats past patterns exactly, another strong move higher could emerge in 2025. EtherNasyonal predicts a potential price surge toward $10 before the distribution phase kicks in.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/which-defi-altcoin-will-deliver-50x-gains-by-2026-mutuum-finance-mutm-or-cardano-ada/",
        "body": "With the clock ticking on 2026, investors are pinpointing which DeFi altcoin will provide the type of blistering returns that characterize bull runs and the battle between Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Cardano (ADA) is getting hot. Cardano, one of the leading smart contract platforms of its time, continues innovating with fresh upgrades that it hopes will facilitate better scalability and growth in its DeFi ecosystem. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming the clear victor. Sold for just $0.035 during presale, Mutuum Finance is constructed on a dual lending economy, real-yield tokenomics, and a non-custodial smart contract infrastructure that provides much higher flexibility and utility than traditional DeFi networks. With more than 16,700 owners, over $16.7 million raised in its presale, the project is now regarded as the most asymmetrically promising DeFi project. Mutuum Finance could 50x by 2026 and perhaps be the most promising Cardano alternative in the next market cycle. Cardano (ADA) Hits Pivotal Crossroads as Consolidation Drags In Cardano (ADA) has spent most of 2025 stuck in a maddening mode of consolidation, repeatedly failing to break the all-critical $1.20 resistance level even after several attempts throughout the year. Now trading in a narrow range of $0.7574 and $0.8156 after breaking below critical support, ADA appears to be hitting its tipping point. Technical charts confirm this tension building: Bollinger Bands have the price just a hair above the lower band, usually a signal of oversold levels, and the RSI reading of 43.6 says that sentiment remains neutral and could turn either direction. Experts warn that failure at $0.7574 can trigger a spasm lower, and a big breakout over $0.8156 can bring about a recovery to $1.20. As investors hold their breath for ADA’s next breakthrough, investors are also looking towards new trends in the DeFi segment, with increasing interest in trailblazing project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) showing where money might go next. MUTM Presale Momentum Picks Up Pace MUTM tokens currently sell at $0.035 in Presale Round 6, an increase of 16.17% from the previous round. Investor demand remains very high with over 16,700 investors sending over $16.7 million so far. As a further step towards enhancing platform security, Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, and white-hat hackers and developers can report bugs. Four levels of bug severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, are available so that problems could be detected and resolved early. The protocol is built on strong collateral management to protect both the participants and the network. Unlimited collateral ratios, lending limits, and deposit limits are some of the characteristics that make it safe. Real-time closing of undercollateral positions and remediation penalties and fees stabilize the platform and reduce systemic risk. Efficiency is at the heart of Mutuum Finance’s architecture. Through the optimization of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and the taking of overcollateralized positions, the protocol engages the highest possible amount of capital with robust guards. Reserve requirements serve to act as a shock absorber to market volatilities, with overlying reserves able to be leveraged in higher-risk assets in order to hedge volatility. Mutuum Finance is reshaping decentralized finance along three central axes: long-term sustainability, trust, and usability. Its secure, scalable lending and borrowing platform is taking DeFi to retail and institutional investors. As a gesture to its growing community, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway wherein 10 winners will each be given $10,000 in MUTM tokens. The gesture reflects the platform’s readiness to reward early adopters, as well as make the vision of the project more prominent. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is raising over $16.7 million from 16,700+ wallets, and over 55% of Phase 6 presale is sold at $0.035. As Cardano (ADA) struggles, MUTM offers high-upside potential with its dual lending economy, safe smart contracts, and robust risk management. A $50,000 CertiK bug bounty and $100,000 giveaway bonus reward early adopters. Acquire MUTM tokens before presale ends.

Analysts now target $6,400 with multi-year projections between $7,000–$12,000, citing accumulation and macro adoption drivers. Strongest quarterly candle: ETH closed above $4,000, flipping resistance into support. On-chain withdrawals of ~420,000 ETH reduced exchange balances, indicating accumulation.

Ethereum breakout: ETH posts strongest quarterly close above $4,000; read expert targets and on-chain signals. View market levels, support and next steps. What is driving the Ethereum breakout above $4,000? Ethereum breakout was driven by a historic quarterly close that turned $4,000 resistance into support, combined with major on-chain withdrawals and renewed demand from institutional and retail buyers. Short-term momentum, reduced exchange supply, and bullish market structure supported upside projections. Ethereum records its strongest quarterly close above $4,000 with $6,400 in sight as analysts project $7K–$12K targets for 2025. Ethereum posts strongest quarterly candle, breaking $4,000 resistance with $6,400 target in sight. On-chain data shows 420,000 ETH withdrawn, reducing exchange supply and signaling strong accumulation. Analysts project Ethereum could reach $7,000–$12,000 in 2025, with possible extension toward $15,000. Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum after recording its most powerful quarterly candle on record. ETH broke above long-standing resistance and secured the highest quarterly close in history. Analysts and on-chain metrics indicate important upside targets and supportive fundamentals. How did Ethereum break resistance with the strongest quarterly close? Technical analysis shows repeated failures at $4,000 between 2022 and 2025 before a confirmed breakout. The breakout candle established new market structure and turned resistance into support, adding momentum to Ethereum’s upward trajectory. According to analysis prepared by Titan of Crypto, the quarterly consolidation ended with a decisive close that validated higher highs and higher lows since early 2023. That structure fueled short-term targets while reinforcing longer-term bullish scenarios. #Ethereum is Insanely Bullish Right Now #ETH just broke out with its strongest quarterly candle ever. Target could be $6,400. pic.twitter.com/cvOMiTFCT9 — Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) October 1, 2025 Chart projections highlighted an initial upside objective near $6,400, with additional longer-range projections toward $6,800 and above. Market structure confirmed sustained buying pressure and higher demand throughout recent quarters. Source: CoinMarketCap Each quarterly candle reinforced the bullish structure and placed Ethereum within reach of higher targets. At the time of this report ETH traded at $4,392.51 with a daily gain of 1.81% and a market capitalization of $530.19 billion. Daily trading volume measured $45.56 billion, up 5.51%. Why are on-chain withdrawals significant for price momentum? On-chain metrics showed roughly 420,000 ETH withdrawn from exchange wallets, sending exchange balances to nine-year lows. This reduction in available supply typically lowers selling pressure and signals accumulation by larger holders. Withdrawal data (source: Coinglass, presented as plain text) suggests a tightening supply-demand dynamic. Lower exchange balances historically correlate with improved price resilience during bullish runs. Market Activity and Expert Predictions At Korea Blockchain Week 2025, Tom Lee (FundStrat) projected that Ethereum could reach $7,000–$12,000 by year-end, with a possible extension toward $15,000 within a new multi-year cycle. He cited artificial intelligence and finance as structural demand drivers. Source: MichaelvandePoppe(X) Analyst Michael van de Poppe noted that Ethereum has been holding up well versus Bitcoin, pointing to continued momentum. ETH/BTC displayed a 144.27% rise since May 2025 before a retracement to 0.03664, with clear buying zones identified. What are the immediate technical levels to watch? Immediate support sits near $4,300. Key upside objectives include $4,406 and $4,565 followed by projection targets at $6,400 and higher.

About 420,000 ETH were withdrawn, pushing exchange balances to nine-year lows. This matters because lower exchange supply reduces potential selling pressure and often correlates with stronger price support. Will analyst targets guarantee price movement to $7,000–$12,000? Analyst targets reflect scenarios based on current momentum and macro themes; they are not guarantees. These projections incorporate technical structure, on-chain flows, and macro adoption indicators. Key Takeaways Breakout confirmed : Ethereum closed the quarter above $4,000, converting resistance into support. On-chain accumulation : ~420,000 ETH withdrawn from exchanges signals lower sell pressure. Analyst outlook : Targets range from $6,400 near-term to $7K–$12K for 2025, with some extensions toward $15K; monitor support and exchange flows. Conclusion This report shows Ethereum in a strong bullish phase after the highest quarterly close in history, supported by significant on-chain withdrawals and bullish market structure. Watch $4,300 as immediate support and aggregate analyst targets for longer-term planning.

        "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) attracted attention by surpassing the $121,000 level for the first time since breaking the record seven weeks ago. The ongoing speculation of a government shutdown in the US is accelerating investors' flight to safe-haven assets. Bitcoin, long dubbed “digital gold” by cryptocurrency advocates, continued its rise despite gold's retreat from record highs. “We're seeing the macro theme dominate Bitcoin again,” said Karim Dandashy, an OTC trader at Flowdesk. “We've seen $1.5 billion in ETF inflows this week, and Bitcoin is trying to match gold's phenomenal rally in recent weeks.” Altcoins also saw gains, with Solana gaining 5.7%, Litecoin 6.7%, and Dogecoin 4.7%. Crypto-related company stocks also followed suit, with Coinbase rising 7.8%, Strategy, known for its Bitcoin treasury, gaining 3.5%, and mining company MARA Holdings rising 2.1%. Related News: Nasdaq-Listed Company Makes Unexpected Investment in Altcoin FalconX Research President David Lawant argued that the market had been waiting for a breakout for a long time, saying, “There has been seller pressure on spot order books for months, but the price hasn't broken through. This demonstrates the classic squeeze dynamic that can lead to explosive price increases as supply dries up. We may be seeing exactly that scenario in the market right now.” Another factor supporting the rise is Bitcoin's historically strong performance in October. This period is known as “Uptober” in the crypto market. Syncracy Capital co-founder Ryan Watkins said, “September is typically the weakest month for Bitcoin, but the fourth quarter tends to be the strongest. I'm not a big believer in seasonality, but I think it often becomes a self-fulfilling expectation.” *This is not investment advice.

Dogecoin consolidates between $0.220–$0.240 with $0.22 as firm support. Hidden bullish divergence (higher lows in price vs lower lows in RSI) favors continuation if volume supports moves. Sustained buying above $0.240 could open a breakout target near $0.34; 24h volume reported at $3.43B. Dogecoin price consolidation at $0.22–$0.24, breakout watch above $0.240; track volume for confirmation — read the latest analysis and trading steps. What is Dogecoin price doing now? Dogecoin price is trading in a consolidation corridor between $0.220 and $0.240 after a September rally, holding $0.22 as critical support while analysts note a hidden bullish divergence that could favor an upside continuation toward $0.34 if resistance at $0.240 is cleared. How is DOGE consolidating and which levels matter? DOGE moved into a narrow range following a peak near $0.307–$0.315 and has since oscillated between $0.220 and $0.240. Recent 24-hour data shows a 9.6% gain to approximately $0.256, with a trading range of $0.2335–$0.2576, volume of $3.43 billion and market cap around $38.67 billion. Key levels: $0.22 (support), $0.240 (immediate resistance), and $0.34 (target on confirmed breakout). Consolidation reflects balanced demand and supply. Technical observers, including public commentary by BitGuru and price snapshots from Coingecko, noted the rejection near $0.307 that preceded the sideways action. Consolidation After Rally Dogecoin recorded a strong rally earlier in September that carried prices toward $0.307 before facing a sharp rejection. Since then, price action has moved into a controlled consolidation between $0.220 and $0.240 as the market digests recent gains and tests support. $DOGE showed a strong rally earlier with a bullish beauty run toward $0.307 before facing a sharp rejection. since then, price has been consolidating in a range between $0.220 and $0.240, with the market now trying to pull back. pic.twitter.com/zFCePJO3PT — BitGuru (@bitgu_ru) October 1, 2025 During this period, CoinGecko data indicated Dogecoin maintained a solid base around $0.22, which repeatedly acted as support. Market structure has displayed higher lows, a bullish signal that keeps buyers favored while the $0.22 level holds. Source: Coingecko Why does the hidden bullish divergence matter? A hidden bullish divergence occurs when price forms higher lows while a momentum oscillator (RSI) forms lower lows. This pattern often signals trend continuation rather than reversal. In DOGE’s case, the divergence suggests underlying buying strength despite short-term momentum dips—validation requires rising volume and a close above $0.240. How should traders use key levels and risk management? Monitor $0.22 support: Maintain stops below $0.22 to guard against range breakdowns. Watch $0.240 resistance: A clear daily close above $0.240 with increased volume supports a breakout. Confirm with volume: Look for expanding volume (above $3.43B 24h baseline) to validate directional moves. Set targets and exits: Partial profit-taking near $0.34 on confirmed continuation; reassess if market structure breaks. Frequently Asked Questions Is $0.22 a reliable support for Dogecoin? Yes. Multiple sessions show $0.22 acting as a firm base, and technical structure with higher lows supports its status as reliable short-term support while consolidation persists. How likely is a breakout to $0.34? A breakout to $0.34 is plausible if DOGE closes above $0.240 with increasing volume and preserved market structure; traders should seek confirmation from volume and daily candle closes. Key Takeaways Support confirmed : $0.22 has repeatedly held, forming the foundation for potential upside. Resistance to watch : $0.240 is the immediate barrier; a daily close above it is required for breakout scenarios. Trade plan : Use volume confirmation and stops below $0.22; consider partial targets near $0.34 on strength. Conclusion Dogecoin remains locked in a short-term consolidation between $0.220 and $0.240 while maintaining a bullish bias supported by a hidden divergence and higher lows. Traders should watch $0.240 for breakout confirmation and track volume and market structure before positioning for a move toward $0.34.

        "url": "https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-leads-uptober-maxi-doge-hype-builds/",
        "body": "October is already living up to its “Uptober” reputation, with the market flashing green on the first trading day of the month. Meme coins have bounced back to an $81 billion valuation, with Dogecoin (DOGE) leading the pack after a 9% overnight gain. But there’s a new pup ready to make its presence felt in this bullish revival: Maxi Doge (MAXI) . This jacked-up cousin of DOGE has his eyes straining pink – not from lack of sleep, but from reading every page of the “Book of Gains” in the “Broble”, searching for how far his muscles can take him in dethroning DOGE. And now every bro who’s studied the “Scriptures of Superset” can join in, by getting the token that best represents the grind they live by. But the clock is ticking. There are only 11 hours left for the chance to buy MAXI at $0.00026 before the next round starts with a higher price per token. DOGE’s Next Wave Could Push Meme Coins Higher Dogecoin is to the meme coin sector what Bitcoin is to crypto – the benchmark. The so-called “top dog” got there by being a pioneer and now carries a hefty $38 billion valuation. Investors who held DOGE through its early slumps were rewarded. From its lows in 2015, DOGE rocketed about 291,000%, turning many into crypto millionaires. But since peaking in 2021, DOGE has yet to reclaim its all-time high. At today’s price of $0.2546, it still sits about 65.3% below its peak – though steadily inching closer. One analyst, however, believes that DOGE is not just on track to revisit its $0.7316 ATH but to break far past it. Korean chartist XForce Global shared an Elliott Wave count showing DOGE finishing its corrective wave IV and entering wave V – the final bullish push of the cycle – with a target of $1.56 per DOGE in the main scenario. $DOGE Still very bullish on the macro for #DOGE . $DOGE still amazes me because it has a pretty conventional textbook 5-wave move since its inception. This cycle should finish with a ATH, w/ a minimum target around $1 (realistic), and a maximum target going into double digits. pic.twitter.com/8NcY32WyXo — XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) September 5, 2025 The pattern remains valid unless DOGE falls below its wave IV low, which so far has held. An alternative long-term count even projects DOGE could reach $16 within the next decade. If these predictions materialize, the impact on the meme coin sector could be massive, breathing new life and tons of fresh capital into the space. And just as DOGE once set the standard for meme coins, the door opens for others carrying the same banner culture that it waved proudly. But one contender is out to do more than follow. It wants to lift heavier, flex harder, and claim the spot as the true top dog. That’s none other than Maxi Doge . Against DOGE, MAXI Flexes the Full-Send Logic Only Bros Understand What Maxi Doge has is a chip on his shoulder – like slapping another plate on the bar just to prove a point. He’s here to show he’s the new alpha in town, rolling in with the kind of muscular build that says he never skips sets and eyes that look like they’ve stared down failure at 3 a.m. under a squat rack. That’s the frame he’s flexing to claim top dog status in the crypto space. Its appeal runs deep with the bros – the same guys who blast EDM until their ears ring and treat a 5,000-calorie cheat meal as a badge of honor. That all-in, all-out mentality spills straight into their trading appetite – chasing Ws whether it’s betting the house today or the kids tomorrow. For them, MAXI is the shining trophy of bro wisdom: if you shoot for 1,000x, you’d better believe you’re gonna get 1,000x. Because if you’re not aiming that high, then what’s the point of living anyway? And against DOGE, this kind of logic is unmatched. Only those who understand the pure art of “trust me bro investing” – the kind that outlifts Warren Buffett’s value strategy any day of the week – will grasp what it means to hold MAXI and reap the rewards when the pump hits. The Best Meme Coin of 2025? October is shaping up to show just how massive its run can get. Last year, meme coins were the ones that defined the second bullish wave in Q4 – and history could rhyme again this time around. In 2024, a handful of unexpected names stole the spotlight – tokens like Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT). If the market repeats that rhythm and the meme coin sector lifts again, there’s almost certainly going to be a new entrant climbing into the top 10. Maxi Doge isn’t just aiming for a seat at that table – he’s gunning straight past DOGE itself. The difference this time is that MAXI comes prepared. Its presale haul isn’t sitting idle as a huge portion is dedicated to making sure the project is seen, heard, and recognized by the bros who matter most. In fact, a full 60% of funds are concentrated on exposure – marketing, community, and hype mechanics – to make sure MAXI has every chance to step into the spotlight and claim its place as the next top meme coin. And bros are perhaps already taking notice – even top crypto outlet InsideBitcoins has featured MAXI in a video review, calling it the best new meme coin of 2025. Go 1,000x with Maxi Doge So if you’re ready to have your stake in what could be the dog that beats DOGE, head to the Maxi Doge Token official website and connect your favorite wallet such as Best Wallet, which is recognized as one of the best crypto wallets in the space. Swap ETH, BNB, USDT, or USDC, or pay directly with a bank card. Best Wallet can be downloaded on Google Play and the Apple App Store .

        "title": "Ethereum Sharp Exchange Outflows Sparks A Historic Supply Squeeze, Here’s What It Means",
        "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-sharp-exchange-outflows/",
        "body": "In a sudden upside move, Ethereum has strongly reclaimed above the $4,300 price mark as bullish sentiment gradually returns to the crypto market. At the same time, a massive amount of ETH has been observed leaving centralized crypto exchanges, which has led to one of the most crucial moments for the leading altcoin in the ongoing bull market cycle. Unprecedented Supply Shock For Ethereum Looms With the price of Ethereum recovering sharply once again, the bullish sentiment and action of investors on crypto exchanges have intensified. Alphractal, an advanced investment and on-chain data analytics platform, revealed that Ethereum is undergoing one of its most dramatic supply movements to date, as large quantities of ETH continue to flee centralized exchanges at an accelerating pace. According to the on-chain platform, the persistent withdrawal of ETH has created a historic supply squeeze. This is due to the fact that the quantity of ETH leaving crypto exchanges is now above the ability to accumulate more for the first time in history. The record-breaking supply squeeze demonstrates an increasing tendency among investors to prioritize long-term holding and staking over active trading. As a result, there is a decrease in the available liquidity in the market. In recent months, the data shows that billions of dollars worth of ETH have been withdrawn from crypto exchanges, regardless of whether you look at Netflow in ETH or USD value. Despite the massive withdrawal, Alphractal highlighted that the Exchange Flux Balance is what truly sticks out. The Exchange Flux Balance is a crucial metric that gauges the cumulative net flow of exchanges. It is worth noting that high values on this metric suggest that inflows are outperforming outflows and that exchanges are increasing their reserves. Meanwhile, low or negative values indicate that exchanges do not have the capacity to accumulate enough, hence creating a supply squeeze. Currently, this metric has gone negative for the first time ever, indicating strong institutional and public demand for ETH . Simply put, Ethereum is experiencing the strongest market maker interest since its launch, a structure that might flare up the market soon. ETH Closed Q3 On A Very Bullish Note As Q4 of 2025 kicks off, speculations are whether this quarter will be just as bullish as the recently finished Q3. Data from leading crypto researcher and analytics platform CryptoRank reveals that ETH experienced a very positive Q3, recording about 66.7% price gain. According to the platform, Q3 of 2025 was a breakout quarter for the altcoin, as it finally broke past its previous all-time high and exhibited strong upside action. One of the major factors that fueled this surge is the US legislative moves, which consistently pushed stablecoins and DeFi into the mainstream. Naturally, Ethereum became one of the major beneficiaries of this regulation change because the leading blockchain continues to be the foundation layer for both stablecoins and DeFi activity. With ETH witnessing a more bullish Q4 in the last 10 years, it is possible that this quarter could end on a positive note.",

Moonbirds BIRB token is an announced ecosystem token for the Moonbirds NFT collection, planned to launch on Solana to add utility and liquidity to the project. The announcement prompted renewed market interest and a short-term rise in Moonbirds secondary sales and floor price. How will launching on Solana affect Moonbirds? Launching BIRB on Solana may provide lower transaction costs and access to a large meme-coin ecosystem, increasing token tradability. Market reaction was immediate: secondary sales spiked, briefly pushing the floor near 4 ETH before leveling at ~3.45 ETH (about $15,450 at time of reporting). Why is community history relevant to this move? Moonbirds was created by Proof Collective in 2022 and saw a dramatic initial surge—about $280 million in trading volume in two days—before the market cooled. Yuga Labs acquired the brand in February 2024, and Orange Cap Games acquired the collection in May 2025, signalling renewed development focus.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/may-struggle-to-rally-in-october-as-mutuum-finances-50-sold-out-presale-stage-6-becomes-talk-of-crypto-twitter/",
        "body": "XRP is facing mounting pressure as October looms on the horizon, with experts warning that poor momentum and macro headwinds might not allow the asset to generate a serious rally in the near future. Despite bullish sentiment regarding regulatory tailwinds and institutional onboarding, XRP price still remains reluctant to overcome key resistance levels, making investors confused regarding its short-term prospects. In the meantime, attention across Crypto Twitter has suddenly shifted in favor of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a strongly emerging DeFi token whose Stage 6 presale is already 55% sold out. With an entry point of only $0.035, a double-lending infrastructure, and real-yield utility, Mutuum Finance is causing much buzz as one of the best altcoin plays of the cycle. Its presale demand sprinting ahead, combined with over 16,700 holders and raising $16.7 million, has turned the project into a possible breakout contender in 2025 that is catching the attention of both retail and deep-pocketed whales looking for high-upside exposure. XRP’s October Record Signals Investors Should Beware as They Search for Greener Pastures Elsewhere Every October, the cryptocurrency market is optimistic that there will be a massive rally in top coins, with investors waiting for huge returns. XRP, though, has no tradition of joining them. Even though the token has periodically registered staggering monthly gains, such as a 94% surge in 2013, a 130% surge in 2014, and a fireworks blast of 179% in 2020, these are the exception rather than the rule. In all but a few other years, October has experienced double-digit falls such as 2018 and 2021, or modest gains which barely meet expectations. Therefore, many investors wary of October’s volatility for XRP are now looking towards Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Picks Up Mutuum Finance is generating increasing excitement and hype for its presale, with the platform already having raised over $16.7 million with over 16,700 investors participating to date. The project is in Stage 6, where MUTM tokens are available for $0.035 per token. As a bonus for early adopters, Mutuum Finance is running a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 users will each be given $10,000 of MUTM tokens. As part of constant security and openness efforts, Mutuum Finance has collaborated with CertiK to launch a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. The program rewards white-hat hackers and security researchers for discovering bugs in the protocol codebase. Bugs are categorized by severity as minor, low, major, or critical, and similar rewards are given to contributors. The protocol is designed to have a dynamic floating interest rate mechanism that maximizes the allocation of liquidity. Low interest rates and times of excess liquidity reward borrowing and ecosystem activity and times of higher demand and higher interest rates reward loan repayment and new capital inflows. Fixed interest structures perform optimally when liquidity is constant, reacting automatically to broader market forces. As a fully decentralized system, Mutuum Finance provides power to MUTM token holders. Lending and borrowing are isolated from the remainder of the system, supported by an interest rate system that best utilizes long-term efficiency, promotes portfolio diversification, and scales with growth in the overall DeFi market. Accurate asset valuation is required for profitable borrowing, lending, and liquidation. For this aim, Mutuum Finance utilizes Chainlink oracles to get real-time USD and leading crypto asset values such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform enhances data accuracy using fallback oracle mechanisms, composite data feeds, and time-weighted averages from decentralized exchanges to offer reliable valuations in the highly volatile and distressed market conditions. MUTM Takes the Spotlight Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most promising DeFi projects for 2025, with over $16.7 million raised from more than 16,700 holders and 55% of its Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per token sold. Whereas XRP is facing historical volatility and short-term resistance, MUTM possesses real utility in the form of a dual lending platform, dynamic interest rate, and USD-pegged stablecoin backed by robust security measures like a $50,000 CertiK bug bounty program. Investors interested in gaining early exposure to a high-upside, utility-led altcoin should purchase MUTM tokens before the end of the presale.

        "url": "https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sinks-6-to-208-while-ethereum-bulls-forecast-10k-in-next-rally/",
        "body": "Solana tanked big time, losing about 6% to nearly $208 . It pretty much underlines the fact that super-fast and high performing Layer 1 chains are quite volatile most of the time. Those traders that were in Solana’s upward trend and were riding the wave got chopped off all of a sudden and now they have to rethink their strategies. But, the traders of Ethereum are enjoying a rebound as Solana pulls back and they are also predicting that the next big rally will push ETH price up to $10K. The difference between these two views illustrates the fact that the crypto market is always shifting between high-beta plays such as Solana and long-term anchors such as Ethereum. One shows speculative speed, the other institutional trust. For investors, these moves fuel a bigger conversation: how to position ahead of the next bull leg. Ethereum’s forecast captures headlines, but the pullback in Solana shows the risks of chasing momentum without balance. At the same time, retail traders are increasingly adding a third category into the mix. While majors like ETH and SOL fight for dominance, speculative presales are winning attention for their potential to deliver 25× or even 50× returns. That is where MAGACOIN FINANCE is being added to watchlists, not as a competitor to Ethereum or Solana, but as a speculative complement. Solana’s High-Beta Volatility The 6% drop of Solana is an example that the cryptocurrency is still known as a high-beta altcoin. The projects from the non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance, and meme token ecosystems moved into Solana’s network, but the asset is still mirroring the risk of speed and leverage. A few analysts have remarked that whereas Solana is persistently drawing techies to build on its chain, the recent volatilities frighten retail investors to exit their positions. On the contrary, whale investors usually take dips like this as a buying opportunity. For traders, Solana remains both exciting and risky. Its ability to generate strong buying rallies draws speculative capital, but its steep corrections prove why risk management is essential. The latest pullback is part of the same pattern that has defined Solana’s entire story, rapid gains balanced by sharp reversals. Ethereum Bulls Predict $10K Ethereum’s steadiness in contrast to Solana’s swings has emboldened bulls. Analysts argue that with institutional adoption growing, tokenization pilots expanding, and Layer 2 scaling solutions maturing, ETH is well-positioned for a dramatic rally. Forecasts of $10K in the next cycle are becoming more common, reflecting confidence that Ethereum is not just a platform but the backbone of digital finance. Institutions see Ethereum as the safe bet for blockchain experimentation, and developers continue to build applications that expand its use cases. For investors with a multi-year horizon, Ethereum offers stability, adoption, and a clear roadmap. Its slower, steadier growth profile makes it an essential anchor in portfolios otherwise exposed to volatility. Solana’s 6% dip contrasts sharply with Ethereum bulls forecasting $10K, but traders looking for higher upside aren’t ignoring presales. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as one of the ROI-heavy candidates, with analysts modelling 750%–1,050% returns depending on listing dynamics. Its scarcity mechanics fuel urgency, ensuring earlier investors hold a significant edge. For those who already hold majors like ETH and SOL, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as the speculative complement. While Solana consolidates and Ethereum builds, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers exposure to asymmetric ROI potential that majors can’t match in a single cycle. Retail Psychology In Action The rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE illustrates retail psychology. Investors want balance: anchors like Ethereum, high-beta opportunities like Solana, and speculative moonshots like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Retail portfolios reflect this structure because it preserves safety while leaving room for extraordinary upside. Meme coins and presales attract attention because they offer possibility. While institutions secure steady gains, retail seeks transformation. That divergence ensures speculative plays always find demand, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as the project to meet it. Positioning For The Next Rally The combination of Solana’s price fluctuations, predictions surrounding Ethereum, and the increase of MAGACOIN FINANCE indicates how traders are positioning themselves ahead of the next bull run. Many investors do not focus on a single strategy, instead choosing to spread their bets on a multitude of different sectors. Some Ethereum-focused large crypto funds have been commercially successful, while others have capitalized on the volatility of Solana, and some have simply invested MAGACOIN FINANCE for the probability of opportunistic multiples. This strategy mirrors the way stock market experts are said to manage their portfolios: a calculated mix of caution and aggression. Investors eliminate the risk of complete loss while still capitalizing on the main allure of crypto: potential gains. Conclusion Solana’s drop of 6% to $208 highlights its unpredictable behavior, while Ethereum supporters keep betting on a $10K uptrend brought by usage and scaling. In essence, these two altcoins highlight the balance between speculative momentum and institutional trust.. Meanwhile, a third storyline is slowly making its way. With its audits, scarcity-driven design, and viral community, MAGACOIN FINANCE is engaging retail investors’ interest as a speculative play complementing ETH and SOL.. As portfolios evolve to balance risk and return, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the kind of opportunity that retail investors seek when the big ones stabilize.To learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit: Website: https://magacoinfinance.com Access: https://magacoinfinance.com/access Twitter/X: https://x.com/magacoinfinance Telegram: https://t.me/magacoinfinance",

        "body": "XRP is approaching a defining moment . Price action has tightened near a crucial resistance zone, and momentum is building in a way that could soon reshape the token’s short-term outlook. Traders and long-term holders are paying close attention, as a respected market analyst has issued a clear signal that could set the stage for the next major move. The latest alert comes from STEPH IS CRYPTO, who shared a detailed analysis on X using the three-daily timeframe. Steph explained, “We are on the verge of a huge breakout,” noting that confirmation requires a decisive daily close above roughly $3. He added, “$2.95 maybe, but $3 to be safe.” According to him, this level is the key trigger that would shift XRP’s technical structure from prolonged consolidation to a breakout phase. MAJOR #XRP ALERT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/iBGRVPp1Fp — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 2, 2025 Technical Outlook: The Breakout Roadmap Steph emphasized that XRP has been trapped in a corrective range since mid-July but is now “kissing the resistance.” If a breakout occurs, he highlighted a series of upside price levels: “The first major target is $3.60 , then we have four dollars, which is also a psychological level, and if we go higher than that, we have 4.63, above 5.” These incremental targets provide a roadmap for traders, marking where XRP may encounter resistance and where profit-taking becomes prudent. Risk Management and Profit Strategy Despite the bullish tone, Steph cautioned against blind optimism. “Make sure to secure these profits on the way up because typically rallies in crypto are very, very short-lived,” he advised. Rather than waiting for a single price objective, he encouraged holders to lock in gains gradually as XRP moves higher. His message is clear: successful trading is about protecting profits, not simply chasing lofty targets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Seasonal Tailwinds: Why Timing Matters Beyond the chart, Steph drew attention to seasonal market behavior, stressing that fear-driven exits could be premature. “This is not the time to be fearful, because historically Q4 always tends to be the best quarter for crypto ,” he said. This historical trend gives additional weight to the breakout scenario, suggesting that broader market conditions may align with the technical setup in favor of XRP. What Holders Should Take Away Steph’s alert is both a warning and an opportunity. Traders should confirm the breakout with their own charts, watch for strong volume to validate the move, and use the cited price levels as strategic checkpoints for profit-taking. His repeated reminder—“lock in the profits on the way up, secure your profits, guys”—underscores the importance of discipline in navigating volatile crypto rallies. The message is straightforward: a confirmed daily close above $3 could unlock the next leg higher for XRP, with price targets ranging from $3.60 to beyond $5. Steph’s analysis offers holders a structured plan—stay patient, wait for confirmation, and manage profits wisely. For XRP investors, this may be the alert that sets the tone for the final quarter of the year. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

        "url": "https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-treasury-push-vivopower-secures-19m-for-expansion/",
        "body": "London-based VivoPower International has raised $19 million in fresh equity at $6.05 per share, a premium to market, with the funds earmarked for its growing XRP digital asset treasury strategy. The move is seen as a show of the company’s deepening commitment to Ripple’s ecosystem at a time when the XRP price action is drawing both optimism and caution from market analysts. Strategic Expansion and Institutional Backing According to an October 1 press release, the raise will supplement a previously disclosed Regulation S offering led by Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki bin Talal Al Saud. It attracted long-term institutional investors in both the U.S. and abroad, with management saying that the fresh funds will support debt retirement while growing the firm’s digital asset strategy focused on the acquisition, management, and long-term holding of XRP. This latest financing follows an announcement in September by VivoPower of a $30 million partnership with Doppler Finance to deploy XRP reserves, the first phase of a planned $200 million allocation. At the same time, the company has been experimenting with Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin for cross-border transactions within its Tembo EV unit. Since early last month, Tembo has been accepting RLUSD for international payments, saying it offers faster settlement and reduced costs compared to traditional banking. However, the decision was not without controversy, sparking debate among XRP supporters about why the firm chose the stablecoin over XRP for payments, though VivoPower did not comment directly on the matter. The Nasdaq-listed firm is among the first to publicly commit sizable treasury resources to XRP, putting it in step with Ripple’s ecosystem growth in areas like tokenization and enterprise-grade payments. Market Context and XRP Performance The timing of VivoPower’s financing coincides with volatile yet largely positive XRP market performance. At the time of this writing, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading at $2.96, up 4.2% over 24 hours and 3.2% across the last seven days. However, it is still down 4.6% over the past fortnight. XRP is holding a 5.9% monthly gain, while its one-year performance shows a nearly 392% growth. The token’s July peak at $3.65 still stands as the all-time high, with current prices about 18.6% below that level. Meanwhile, analysts are still divided over its Q4 prospects. On October 1, market watcher Cobb told his nearly 200,000 followers on X that he sees a path to $6.32 this quarter. Others like Amonyx have set much bolder targets of up to $20, a level that would require XRP’s market cap to fly past $1 trillion. Despite the optimism, some critics have cautioned that the asset’s streak of five consecutive green quarterly closes may be due for a correction, leading to predictions of a red end to 2025.

        "body": "With the clock ticking on 2026, investors are pinpointing which DeFi altcoin will provide the type of blistering returns that characterize bull runs and the battle between Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Cardano (ADA) is getting hot. Cardano, one of the leading smart contract platforms of its time, continues innovating with fresh upgrades that it hopes will facilitate better scalability and growth in its DeFi ecosystem. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming the clear victor. Sold for just $0.035 during presale, Mutuum Finance is constructed on a dual lending economy, real-yield tokenomics, and a non-custodial smart contract infrastructure that provides much higher flexibility and utility than traditional DeFi networks. With more than 16,700 owners, over $16.7 million raised in its presale, the project is now regarded as the most asymmetrically promising DeFi project. Mutuum Finance could 50x by 2026 and perhaps be the most promising Cardano alternative in the next market cycle. Cardano (ADA) Hits Pivotal Crossroads as Consolidation Drags In Cardano (ADA) has spent most of 2025 stuck in a maddening mode of consolidation, repeatedly failing to break the all-critical $1.20 resistance level even after several attempts throughout the year. Now trading in a narrow range of $0.7574 and $0.8156 after breaking below critical support, ADA appears to be hitting its tipping point. Technical charts confirm this tension building: Bollinger Bands have the price just a hair above the lower band, usually a signal of oversold levels, and the RSI reading of 43.6 says that sentiment remains neutral and could turn either direction. Experts warn that failure at $0.7574 can trigger a spasm lower, and a big breakout over $0.8156 can bring about a recovery to $1.20. As investors hold their breath for ADA’s next breakthrough, investors are also looking towards new trends in the DeFi segment, with increasing interest in trailblazing project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) showing where money might go next. MUTM Presale Momentum Picks Up Pace MUTM tokens currently sell at $0.035 in Presale Round 6, an increase of 16.17% from the previous round. Investor demand remains very high with over 16,700 investors sending over $16.7 million so far. As a further step towards enhancing platform security, Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, and white-hat hackers and developers can report bugs. Four levels of bug severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, are available so that problems could be detected and resolved early. The protocol is built on strong collateral management to protect both the participants and the network. Unlimited collateral ratios, lending limits, and deposit limits are some of the characteristics that make it safe. Real-time closing of undercollateral positions and remediation penalties and fees stabilize the platform and reduce systemic risk. Efficiency is at the heart of Mutuum Finance’s architecture. Through the optimization of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and the taking of overcollateralized positions, the protocol engages the highest possible amount of capital with robust guards. Reserve requirements serve to act as a shock absorber to market volatilities, with overlying reserves able to be leveraged in higher-risk assets in order to hedge volatility. Mutuum Finance is reshaping decentralized finance along three central axes: long-term sustainability, trust, and usability. Its secure, scalable lending and borrowing platform is taking DeFi to retail and institutional investors. As a gesture to its growing community, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway wherein 10 winners will each be given $10,000 in MUTM tokens. The gesture reflects the platform’s readiness to reward early adopters, as well as make the vision of the project more prominent. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is raising over $16.7 million from 16,700+ wallets, and over 55% of Phase 6 presale is sold at $0.035. As Cardano (ADA) struggles, MUTM offers high-upside potential with its dual lending economy, safe smart contracts, and robust risk management. A $50,000 CertiK bug bounty and $100,000 giveaway bonus reward early adopters. Acquire MUTM tokens before presale ends.

        "title": "Ethereum Sharp Exchange Outflows Sparks A Historic Supply Squeeze, Here’s What It Means",
        "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-sharp-exchange-outflows/",
        "body": "In a sudden upside move, Ethereum has strongly reclaimed above the $4,300 price mark as bullish sentiment gradually returns to the crypto market. At the same time, a massive amount of ETH has been observed leaving centralized crypto exchanges, which has led to one of the most crucial moments for the leading altcoin in the ongoing bull market cycle. Unprecedented Supply Shock For Ethereum Looms With the price of Ethereum recovering sharply once again, the bullish sentiment and action of investors on crypto exchanges have intensified. Alphractal, an advanced investment and on-chain data analytics platform, revealed that Ethereum is undergoing one of its most dramatic supply movements to date, as large quantities of ETH continue to flee centralized exchanges at an accelerating pace. According to the on-chain platform, the persistent withdrawal of ETH has created a historic supply squeeze. This is due to the fact that the quantity of ETH leaving crypto exchanges is now above the ability to accumulate more for the first time in history. The record-breaking supply squeeze demonstrates an increasing tendency among investors to prioritize long-term holding and staking over active trading. As a result, there is a decrease in the available liquidity in the market. In recent months, the data shows that billions of dollars worth of ETH have been withdrawn from crypto exchanges, regardless of whether you look at Netflow in ETH or USD value. Despite the massive withdrawal, Alphractal highlighted that the Exchange Flux Balance is what truly sticks out. The Exchange Flux Balance is a crucial metric that gauges the cumulative net flow of exchanges. It is worth noting that high values on this metric suggest that inflows are outperforming outflows and that exchanges are increasing their reserves. Meanwhile, low or negative values indicate that exchanges do not have the capacity to accumulate enough, hence creating a supply squeeze. Currently, this metric has gone negative for the first time ever, indicating strong institutional and public demand for ETH . Simply put, Ethereum is experiencing the strongest market maker interest since its launch, a structure that might flare up the market soon. ETH Closed Q3 On A Very Bullish Note As Q4 of 2025 kicks off, speculations are whether this quarter will be just as bullish as the recently finished Q3. Data from leading crypto researcher and analytics platform CryptoRank reveals that ETH experienced a very positive Q3, recording about 66.7% price gain. According to the platform, Q3 of 2025 was a breakout quarter for the altcoin, as it finally broke past its previous all-time high and exhibited strong upside action. One of the major factors that fueled this surge is the US legislative moves, which consistently pushed stablecoins and DeFi into the mainstream. Naturally, Ethereum became one of the major beneficiaries of this regulation change because the leading blockchain continues to be the foundation layer for both stablecoins and DeFi activity. With ETH witnessing a more bullish Q4 in the last 10 years, it is possible that this quarter could end on a positive note.",

        "body": "Bitcoin (BTC) attracted attention by surpassing the $121,000 level for the first time since breaking the record seven weeks ago. The ongoing speculation of a government shutdown in the US is accelerating investors' flight to safe-haven assets. Bitcoin, long dubbed “digital gold” by cryptocurrency advocates, continued its rise despite gold's retreat from record highs. “We're seeing the macro theme dominate Bitcoin again,” said Karim Dandashy, an OTC trader at Flowdesk. “We've seen $1.5 billion in ETF inflows this week, and Bitcoin is trying to match gold's phenomenal rally in recent weeks.” Altcoins also saw gains, with Solana gaining 5.7%, Litecoin 6.7%, and Dogecoin 4.7%. Crypto-related company stocks also followed suit, with Coinbase rising 7.8%, Strategy, known for its Bitcoin treasury, gaining 3.5%, and mining company MARA Holdings rising 2.1%. Related News: Nasdaq-Listed Company Makes Unexpected Investment in Altcoin FalconX Research President David Lawant argued that the market had been waiting for a breakout for a long time, saying, “There has been seller pressure on spot order books for months, but the price hasn't broken through. This demonstrates the classic squeeze dynamic that can lead to explosive price increases as supply dries up. We may be seeing exactly that scenario in the market right now.” Another factor supporting the rise is Bitcoin's historically strong performance in October. This period is known as “Uptober” in the crypto market. Syncracy Capital co-founder Ryan Watkins said, “September is typically the weakest month for Bitcoin, but the fourth quarter tends to be the strongest. I'm not a big believer in seasonality, but I think it often becomes a self-fulfilling expectation.” *This is not investment advice.

RLUSD minting raised RLUSD’s supply by $1.8M, valuing it at $789M (8th-largest stablecoin). Stablecoin supply growth often precedes higher trading activity and altcoin demand. Market context: total crypto cap ~$4T, stablecoin cap ~$309B, Altcoin Season Index at 66.

RLUSD minting refers to Ripple Labs adding $1.8 million of supply to its RLUSD stablecoin, increasing its total valuation to about $789 million. This expansion matters because fresh stablecoin issuance can indicate incoming liquidity and higher buying capacity for spot markets. How does RLUSD minting affect altcoins and XRP? New stablecoins typically act as market liquidity reservoirs that traders use to buy altcoins and major tokens. With the overall crypto market cap near $4 trillion and the stablecoin market capitalisation around $309 billion, added RLUSD supply can support increased trading and price discovery. Data points to watch: the Altcoin Season Index reading of 66 suggests growing altcoin demand (a 75+ reading confirms a broad altseason). The Fear & Greed Index at 51 shows neutral sentiment while investors accumulate selectively. Stablecoin market as a signal: What should traders watch? Stablecoin minting is often a short-term liquidity gauge. When issuers add supply, it implies capital is ready to flow into markets rather than sit idle. Key metrics: total stablecoin cap (~$309B), 24H stablecoin trading volume (~$206B), and rank changes in stablecoin market share. Monitoring these helps assess whether RLUSD’s mint leads to sustained asset purchases. Source: TradingView (plain text) RLUSD’s $1.8M mint coincided with the crypto market reclaiming the $4 trillion threshold, a sign that investors are rotating capital back into crypto. Historically, such recoveries increase on-chain activity and exchange inflows. How is the Altcoin Season Index shaping expectations? The Altcoin Season Index at 66 signals rising altcoin breadth but not a full altseason. At 75+ the market typically shows widespread alt gains; current readings suggest pockets of strength with room to run. Investors should balance position sizing and watch on-chain spot flows for confirmation. Source: CoinMarketCap (plain text) Are investors buying XRP now? Netflow data shows mixed behavior. Between 28 September and 1 October, buyers accumulated roughly $110.9 million of XRP. A short-term reversal returned about $20.05 million in the 24-hour period ending 2 October, indicating renewed spot demand. Technicals: XRP formed a bull-flag pattern on daily charts with a near-term measured target around $3.50. The Accumulation/Distribution indicator trending positive supports buying pressure; market volume near 74.75 billion XRP shows activity remains elevated.

RLUSD’s mint is a liquidity event, not a directional certainty; watch spot flows into exchanges, orderbook depth, and major support/resistance levels. Source: TradingView (plain text) Frequently Asked Questions How large is RLUSD after the $1.8M mint? RLUSD’s market valuation is roughly $789 million after the $1.8 million mint, placing it among the top ten stablecoins by capitalization at publication time. Can RLUSD minting trigger an altcoin rally? RLUSD minting can add liquidity that fuels altcoin purchases, but a sustained rally requires broad stablecoin supply growth plus favorable on-chain flows and market sentiment. What technical signs support an XRP breakout? XRP’s daily bull-flag pattern, rising A/D indicator, and positive spot netflows suggest a higher-probability breakout, with a near-term target around $3.50 if volume confirms the move. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How large is RLUSD after the $1.8M mint?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"RLUSD’s market valuation is roughly $789 million after the $1.8 million mint, placing it among the top ten stablecoins by capitalization at publication time.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Can RLUSD minting trigger an altcoin rally?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"RLUSD minting can add liquidity that supports altcoin purchases, but a sustained rally requires broader stablecoin growth, sustained on-chain inflows, and improving sentiment.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"What technical signs support an XRP breakout?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"A bull-flag on daily charts, rising Accumulation/Distribution values, and positive spot netflows are the primary technical and flow-based signs that support a potential XRP breakout.\" } } ]} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to interpret RLUSD minting signals\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/#step1\", \"name\": \"Check stablecoin supply\", \"itemListElement\": { \"@type\": \"HowToDirection\", \"text\": \"Confirm the amount minted and the updated market cap of RLUSD.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/#step2\", \"name\": \"Monitor on-chain flows\", \"itemListElement\": { \"@type\": \"HowToDirection\", \"text\": \"Watch spot exchange netflows and stablecoin movement to exchanges.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/#step3\", \"name\": \"Combine with technicals\", \"itemListElement\": { \"@type\": \"HowToDirection\", \"text\": \"Use chart patterns and volume confirmation before taking positions.\" } } ]} Key Takeaways RLUSD minting: A $1.8M addition lifted RLUSD to ~$789M, signaling added liquidity potential. Market context: Crypto cap near $4T, stablecoin cap ~$309B, Altcoin Season Index at 66 — room for further upside. Investor action: Watch spot netflows, orderbook depth and technical confirmations on XRP before trading. Conclusion RLUSD’s $1.8 million mint is a measurable liquidity event that raises the stablecoin’s profile and adds buying capacity for the market. Combined with broader metrics — a $4T crypto cap, rising Altcoin Season Index and positive XRP flows — the signal favors cautious optimism.

        "title": "Which DeFi Altcoin Will Deliver 50x Gains by 2026: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) or Cardano (ADA)?",
        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/which-defi-altcoin-will-deliver-50x-gains-by-2026-mutuum-finance-mutm-or-cardano-ada/",
        "body": "With the clock ticking on 2026, investors are pinpointing which DeFi altcoin will provide the type of blistering returns that characterize bull runs and the battle between Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Cardano (ADA) is getting hot. Cardano, one of the leading smart contract platforms of its time, continues innovating with fresh upgrades that it hopes will facilitate better scalability and growth in its DeFi ecosystem. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming the clear victor. Sold for just $0.035 during presale, Mutuum Finance is constructed on a dual lending economy, real-yield tokenomics, and a non-custodial smart contract infrastructure that provides much higher flexibility and utility than traditional DeFi networks. With more than 16,700 owners, over $16.7 million raised in its presale, the project is now regarded as the most asymmetrically promising DeFi project. Mutuum Finance could 50x by 2026 and perhaps be the most promising Cardano alternative in the next market cycle. Cardano (ADA) Hits Pivotal Crossroads as Consolidation Drags In Cardano (ADA) has spent most of 2025 stuck in a maddening mode of consolidation, repeatedly failing to break the all-critical $1.20 resistance level even after several attempts throughout the year. Now trading in a narrow range of $0.7574 and $0.8156 after breaking below critical support, ADA appears to be hitting its tipping point. Technical charts confirm this tension building: Bollinger Bands have the price just a hair above the lower band, usually a signal of oversold levels, and the RSI reading of 43.6 says that sentiment remains neutral and could turn either direction. Experts warn that failure at $0.7574 can trigger a spasm lower, and a big breakout over $0.8156 can bring about a recovery to $1.20. As investors hold their breath for ADA’s next breakthrough, investors are also looking towards new trends in the DeFi segment, with increasing interest in trailblazing project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) showing where money might go next. MUTM Presale Momentum Picks Up Pace MUTM tokens currently sell at $0.035 in Presale Round 6, an increase of 16.17% from the previous round. Investor demand remains very high with over 16,700 investors sending over $16.7 million so far. As a further step towards enhancing platform security, Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, and white-hat hackers and developers can report bugs. Four levels of bug severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, are available so that problems could be detected and resolved early. The protocol is built on strong collateral management to protect both the participants and the network. Unlimited collateral ratios, lending limits, and deposit limits are some of the characteristics that make it safe. Real-time closing of undercollateral positions and remediation penalties and fees stabilize the platform and reduce systemic risk. Efficiency is at the heart of Mutuum Finance’s architecture. Through the optimization of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and the taking of overcollateralized positions, the protocol engages the highest possible amount of capital with robust guards. Reserve requirements serve to act as a shock absorber to market volatilities, with overlying reserves able to be leveraged in higher-risk assets in order to hedge volatility. Mutuum Finance is reshaping decentralized finance along three central axes: long-term sustainability, trust, and usability. Its secure, scalable lending and borrowing platform is taking DeFi to retail and institutional investors. As a gesture to its growing community, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway wherein 10 winners will each be given $10,000 in MUTM tokens. The gesture reflects the platform’s readiness to reward early adopters, as well as make the vision of the project more prominent. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is raising over $16.7 million from 16,700+ wallets, and over 55% of Phase 6 presale is sold at $0.035. As Cardano (ADA) struggles, MUTM offers high-upside potential with its dual lending economy, safe smart contracts, and robust risk management. A $50,000 CertiK bug bounty and $100,000 giveaway bonus reward early adopters. Acquire MUTM tokens before presale ends.

        "url": "https://timestabloid.com/top-exchange-xrp-loyalty-deserves-more-than-words/",
        "body": "In the ever-volatile world of digital assets, loyalty is a rare and powerful force. It cannot be manufactured through marketing slogans alone — it is earned over time, battle-tested through market cycles, regulatory hurdles, and community conviction. Few crypto assets have demonstrated this resilience as clearly as XRP, whose community has weathered years of uncertainty yet remained steadfast in its belief in the token’s long-term role in global finance. Now, a leading exchange is signaling that such loyalty is about to be rewarded in ways that extend far beyond words. Uphold’s Message to XRP Holders On October 1, 2025, Uphold — a global exchange and digital asset custodian — posted on X: “XRP loyalty deserves more than words. Soon, it will.” The post, though brief, carries weight. Uphold has built a reputation for aligning closely with XRP’s community, and this message suggests that the platform intends to deepen that relationship through tangible incentives. While the details remain under wraps, the announcement has sparked significant discussion among market watchers. XRP loyalty deserves more than words. Soon, it will. — Uphold (@UpholdInc) October 1, 2025 Uphold’s Track Record of XRP Rewards This is not the first time Uphold has linked XRP with real-world rewards. Earlier in 2025, the exchange introduced a direct-deposit cashback feature, granting eligible users 4% of their paychecks back in XRP. This initiative turned a routine financial action into an investment opportunity, further embedding XRP into users’ everyday lives. Beyond cashback, Uphold’s broader rewards framework has offered perks like elevated yields on stablecoins and exclusive access to new listings, creating an ecosystem where loyalty translates into measurable benefits. Expanding XRP Utility Through Products Uphold’s approach also goes beyond promotions. The exchange has steadily worked to integrate XRP into practical financial products, including tokenized derivatives and early DeFi-linked offerings. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 These initiatives point toward a vision where XRP is not just held but actively used — for yield generation, liquidity provision, and access to emerging blockchain services. This aligns with broader market demand for exchanges that can provide both secure custody and opportunities for active participation in digital finance. Strategic Timing and Market Implications The timing of Uphold’s statement is no coincidence. With the Ripple vs. SEC legal saga now settled and XRP regaining regulatory clarity, the token has re-entered a growth phase. For Uphold, reinforcing its XRP-focused services now strengthens its competitive edge, particularly as the company explores expansion strategies, including a potential IPO. By converting community loyalty into lasting product advantages, Uphold positions itself not just as an exchange but as a long-term partner in XRP’s ecosystem. Looking Ahead While Uphold has yet to reveal specifics , XRP holders should keep a close watch on official announcements. Any new program is expected to carry eligibility requirements and regional restrictions, so clarity will be essential. Still, if Uphold delivers on its promise, it could set a new industry standard: turning token-based loyalty into recurring, tangible financial benefits. For XRP’s global community, the message is clear — loyalty that has been tested over years of turbulence may finally be rewarded not just with appreciation, but with real, lasting value. And that, as Uphold emphasizes, is worth more than words. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Moonbirds BIRB token is an announced ecosystem token for the Moonbirds NFT collection, planned to launch on Solana to add utility and liquidity to the project. The announcement prompted renewed market interest and a short-term rise in Moonbirds secondary sales and floor price. How will launching on Solana affect Moonbirds? Launching BIRB on Solana may provide lower transaction costs and access to a large meme-coin ecosystem, increasing token tradability. Market reaction was immediate: secondary sales spiked, briefly pushing the floor near 4 ETH before leveling at ~3.45 ETH (about $15,450 at time of reporting). Why is community history relevant to this move? Moonbirds was created by Proof Collective in 2022 and saw a dramatic initial surge—about $280 million in trading volume in two days—before the market cooled. Yuga Labs acquired the brand in February 2024, and Orange Cap Games acquired the collection in May 2025, signalling renewed development focus.

Yes. Project announcements and event teasers indicate BIRB will launch on Solana, with the team describing the launch timing as ‘soon(ish)’. Official launch details are expected before the token drop. How has the market reacted so far? Market reaction has been positive: secondary-market activity increased and the collection’s floor price rose from sub-$1,000 earlier this year to peaks near 4 ETH after the announcement, before settling near 3.45 ETH (~$15,450). Should holders expect immediate token airdrops? No official airdrop has been confirmed. Moonbirds has stated there will be ample lead-up and details communicated prior to launch, suggesting holders will have advance notice of any distribution mechanics.

Market impact: News drove secondary sales and a temporary floor-price spike; traders are pricing potential token utility. Next steps for holders: Monitor official Moonbirds communications for launch timelines and tokenomics. Conclusion The Moonbirds BIRB token announcement on Solana has catalyzed renewed interest and higher NFT floor prices for the collection. With a history that includes Proof Collective, Yuga Labs, and a recent Orange Cap Games acquisition, the project’s next steps will be judged on clear utility and transparent tokenomics.

        "body": "BitcoinWorld Bybit Lists DoubleZero (2Z), Bringing Infrastructure-Backed Token to Traders With 5.5M 2Z Launch Promotion Bybit , the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has listed DoubleZero (2Z) , the token supporting a dedicated low-latency networking layer currently used by more than 300 blockchain validators worldwide. The listing introduces 2Z trading against both USDT and USDC, providing Bybit users access to an infrastructure-based asset designed to enhance block propagation, validator fairness and overall network reliability across distributed systems. Backed by the Solana ecosystem, 2Z is a top-tier project on Solana led by Austin, a former member of the Solana Foundation. DoubleZero takes a physical approach to blockchain scaling. Instead of relying solely on software-level improvements, it operates a permissionless fiber network in which data is routed directly between nodes via independently managed links. This enables faster packet transmission compared to conventional internet pathways, reducing consensus delays and improving performance for validators across diverse geographies. By combining fiber links run by independent contributors with edge filtering hardware in a permissionless network, DoubleZero maintains crypto-economic security guarantees while improving throughput. Deposits for 2Z opened on October 2 at 4:00 a.m. UTC. Trading for the 2Z/USDT pair went live at 1:00 p.m. UTC, followed by 2Z/USDC at 1:30 p.m. Withdrawals are scheduled to open on October 3 at 10:00 a.m. UTC. To coincide with the listing, Bybit has launched a 5.5 million 2Z “Token Splash” promotion . A total of 2,000,000 2Z has been allocated exclusively to new users through a deposit-based campaign running between October 2 and October 10. The first 5,000 participants who meet the qualifying thresholds—either by depositing 2,000 2Z or depositing and trading the equivalent of 100 USDT—will each receive 400 2Z. An additional 3,500,000 2Z has been reserved for trading rewards, open to all users who meet eligibility criteria. Between October 2 at 1:00 p.m. UTC and October 10 at 11:00 a.m. UTC, any user who reaches a cumulative total of 500 USDT or more in 2Z spot trading volume will qualify for proportional rewards, with payouts capped at 1,800 2Z per participant. The listing of 2Z reflects Bybit’s continued focus on onboarding tokens backed by real-world infrastructure usage. As blockchain networks expand, performance improvements at the physical transport layer are becoming increasingly relevant to both institutional and retail participants. DoubleZero’s approach to network acceleration offers a clear example of how hardware-aligned protocols are beginning to play a foundational role in blockchain scalability. #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/may-struggle-to-rally-in-october-as-mutuum-finances-50-sold-out-presale-stage-6-becomes-talk-of-crypto-twitter/",
        "body": "XRP is facing mounting pressure as October looms on the horizon, with experts warning that poor momentum and macro headwinds might not allow the asset to generate a serious rally in the near future. Despite bullish sentiment regarding regulatory tailwinds and institutional onboarding, XRP price still remains reluctant to overcome key resistance levels, making investors confused regarding its short-term prospects. In the meantime, attention across Crypto Twitter has suddenly shifted in favor of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a strongly emerging DeFi token whose Stage 6 presale is already 55% sold out. With an entry point of only $0.035, a double-lending infrastructure, and real-yield utility, Mutuum Finance is causing much buzz as one of the best altcoin plays of the cycle. Its presale demand sprinting ahead, combined with over 16,700 holders and raising $16.7 million, has turned the project into a possible breakout contender in 2025 that is catching the attention of both retail and deep-pocketed whales looking for high-upside exposure. XRP’s October Record Signals Investors Should Beware as They Search for Greener Pastures Elsewhere Every October, the cryptocurrency market is optimistic that there will be a massive rally in top coins, with investors waiting for huge returns. XRP, though, has no tradition of joining them. Even though the token has periodically registered staggering monthly gains, such as a 94% surge in 2013, a 130% surge in 2014, and a fireworks blast of 179% in 2020, these are the exception rather than the rule. In all but a few other years, October has experienced double-digit falls such as 2018 and 2021, or modest gains which barely meet expectations. Therefore, many investors wary of October’s volatility for XRP are now looking towards Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Picks Up Mutuum Finance is generating increasing excitement and hype for its presale, with the platform already having raised over $16.7 million with over 16,700 investors participating to date. The project is in Stage 6, where MUTM tokens are available for $0.035 per token. As a bonus for early adopters, Mutuum Finance is running a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 users will each be given $10,000 of MUTM tokens. As part of constant security and openness efforts, Mutuum Finance has collaborated with CertiK to launch a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. The program rewards white-hat hackers and security researchers for discovering bugs in the protocol codebase. Bugs are categorized by severity as minor, low, major, or critical, and similar rewards are given to contributors. The protocol is designed to have a dynamic floating interest rate mechanism that maximizes the allocation of liquidity. Low interest rates and times of excess liquidity reward borrowing and ecosystem activity and times of higher demand and higher interest rates reward loan repayment and new capital inflows. Fixed interest structures perform optimally when liquidity is constant, reacting automatically to broader market forces. As a fully decentralized system, Mutuum Finance provides power to MUTM token holders. Lending and borrowing are isolated from the remainder of the system, supported by an interest rate system that best utilizes long-term efficiency, promotes portfolio diversification, and scales with growth in the overall DeFi market. Accurate asset valuation is required for profitable borrowing, lending, and liquidation. For this aim, Mutuum Finance utilizes Chainlink oracles to get real-time USD and leading crypto asset values such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform enhances data accuracy using fallback oracle mechanisms, composite data feeds, and time-weighted averages from decentralized exchanges to offer reliable valuations in the highly volatile and distressed market conditions. MUTM Takes the Spotlight Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most promising DeFi projects for 2025, with over $16.7 million raised from more than 16,700 holders and 55% of its Phase 6 presale at $0.035 per token sold. Whereas XRP is facing historical volatility and short-term resistance, MUTM possesses real utility in the form of a dual lending platform, dynamic interest rate, and USD-pegged stablecoin backed by robust security measures like a $50,000 CertiK bug bounty program. Investors interested in gaining early exposure to a high-upside, utility-led altcoin should purchase MUTM tokens before the end of the presale.

        "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/may-struggle-to-rally-in-october-as-mutuum-finances-50-sold-out-presale-stage-6-becomes-talk-of-crypto-twitter/",
        "body": "XRP is facing mounting pressure as October looms on the horizon, with experts warning that poor momentum and macro headwinds might not allow the asset to generate a serious rally in the near future. Despite bullish sentiment regarding regulatory tailwinds and institutional onboarding, XRP price still remains reluctant to overcome key resistance levels, making investors confused regarding its short-term prospects. In the meantime, attention across Crypto Twitter has suddenly shifted in favor of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a strongly emerging DeFi token whose Stage 6 presale is already 55% sold out. With an entry point of only $0.035, a double-lending infrastructure, and real-yield utility, Mutuum Finance is causing much buzz as one of the best altcoin plays of the cycle. Its presale demand sprinting ahead, combined with over 16,700 holders and raising $16.7 million, has turned the project into a possible breakout contender in 2025 that is catching the attention of both retail and deep-pocketed whales looking for high-upside exposure. XRP’s October Record Signals Investors Should Beware as They Search for Greener Pastures Elsewhere Every October, the cryptocurrency market is optimistic that there will be a massive rally in top coins, with investors waiting for huge returns. XRP, though, has no tradition of joining them. Even though the token has periodically registered staggering monthly gains, such as a 94% surge in 2013, a 130% surge in 2014, and a fireworks blast of 179% in 2020, these are the exception rather than the rule. In all but a few other years, October has experienced double-digit falls such as 2018 and 2021, or modest gains which barely meet expectations. Therefore, many investors wary of October’s volatility for XRP are now looking towards Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Picks Up Mutuum Finance is generating increasing excitement and hype for its presale, with the platform already having raised over $16.7 million with over 16,700 investors participating to date. The project is in Stage 6, where MUTM tokens are available for $0.035 per token. As a bonus for early adopters, Mutuum Finance is running a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 users will each be given $10,000 of MUTM tokens.

        "body": "XRP price is testing the $3.00 resistance after a 4% intraday rise and a 9% monthly gain; technicals show a compressing market with weak ADX (14) and neutral RSI (57), so a confirmed breakout requires daily closes above $3.10 with rising ADX. XRP price tests $3.00 but momentum is weak — ADX 14 warns of false breakouts. Prediction markets (Myriad) flipped bullish short-term, but traders remain cautious. EMA alignment and $2.70 support suggest bulls retain longer-term structure; market cap > $182B. XRP price tests $3.00 resistance with weak momentum; watch for daily closes above $3.10 and rising ADX before confirming a bullish breakout. Read more on trade signals. (150-160 chars) What is happening with the XRP price now? XRP price has rallied about 4% today to test the $3.00 level after a 9% rise over 30 days, but technical indicators show a compressing market. Short-term momentum is weak (ADX 14), so bulls need clear confirmation to claim a sustained breakout. How does technical analysis shape the outlook for XRP? Price action shows XRP trapped in a horizontal channel within a descending triangle since July highs near $3.80. The 50-day EMA sits at ~ $3.00 and acts as immediate resistance, while the 200-day EMA near $2.70 serves as stronger support. Traders must watch EMA confluence and ADX for trend validation. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\", \"headline\": \"XRP Price Tests $3.00 as Traders Turn Cautiously Bullish\", \"image\": [\"https://en.coinotag.com/images/xrp-chart.jpg\"], \"datePublished\": \"2025-10-02T08:00:00Z\", \"dateModified\": \"2025-10-02T12:00:00Z\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"COINOTAG\", \"logo\": { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/images/logo.png\" } }, \"description\": \"XRP price is testing $3.00 after a 4% intraday gain; technicals show a compressing market with weak ADX, while prediction market odds lean slightly bullish.\"} Why are prediction markets and traders mixed on XRP? Myriad prediction markets shifted sentiment to a 55% chance of XRP reaching $4 before dropping to $2, reversing last week’s odds. This signals increased upside conviction but not broad consensus. Market participants cite upcoming CME derivatives activity and institutional interest as drivers. What do momentum indicators indicate for XRP? ADX at 14 signals low trend strength and a risk of false breakouts. RSI at 57 is neutral, not warning of immediate exhaustion. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator reads “on,” implying compression ahead of a decisive move; without rising ADX, that move could be either direction. Frequently Asked Questions { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Is XRP price breaking out above $3.00?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"Not yet — XRP is testing $3.00 but ADX remains low at 14.

Use tight risk management and avoid heavy leverage near $3. Set stop-loss orders below $2.95 and scale entries toward $2.70 support. Wait for confirmation: multiple daily closes above $3.10 and a rising ADX are the clearest signals of trend resumption. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to trade XRP around $3.00 resistance\", \"description\": \"Step-by-step approach to trading XRP while it tests the $3.00 resistance level.\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Confirm momentum\", \"text\": \"Wait for ADX to rise above 25 and daily closes above $3.10 before increasing position size.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Manage risk\", \"text\": \"Set stop-losses below $2.95 and avoid excessive leverage that risks liquidation near the $3.00 level.\" }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"name\": \"Scale entries\", \"text\": \"Enter in small increments with additional buys toward $2.70 support if price pulls back.\" } ]} Key Takeaways Momentum is weak : ADX at 14 warns that today’s move may be a false breakout. EMA structure favors bulls long-term : 50-day EMA near $3.00 vs 200-day EMA near $2.70. Trade with confirmation : Look for daily closes above $3.10 and rising ADX before adding risk. Conclusion XRP price is showing renewed upside but remains inside a compression pattern that demands caution. Prediction market sentiment is slightly bullish and EMAs keep the longer-term structure intact, yet weak ADX and neutral RSI require confirmatory price action. Monitor daily closes above $3.10 and ADX momentum before increasing exposure; COINOTAG will update as conditions evolve.

        "body": "XRP is approaching a defining moment . Price action has tightened near a crucial resistance zone, and momentum is building in a way that could soon reshape the token’s short-term outlook. Traders and long-term holders are paying close attention, as a respected market analyst has issued a clear signal that could set the stage for the next major move. The latest alert comes from STEPH IS CRYPTO, who shared a detailed analysis on X using the three-daily timeframe. Steph explained, “We are on the verge of a huge breakout,” noting that confirmation requires a decisive daily close above roughly $3. He added, “$2.95 maybe, but $3 to be safe.” According to him, this level is the key trigger that would shift XRP’s technical structure from prolonged consolidation to a breakout phase. MAJOR #XRP ALERT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/iBGRVPp1Fp — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 2, 2025 Technical Outlook: The Breakout Roadmap Steph emphasized that XRP has been trapped in a corrective range since mid-July but is now “kissing the resistance.” If a breakout occurs, he highlighted a series of upside price levels: “The first major target is $3.60 , then we have four dollars, which is also a psychological level, and if we go higher than that, we have 4.63, above 5.” These incremental targets provide a roadmap for traders, marking where XRP may encounter resistance and where profit-taking becomes prudent. Risk Management and Profit Strategy Despite the bullish tone, Steph cautioned against blind optimism. “Make sure to secure these profits on the way up because typically rallies in crypto are very, very short-lived,” he advised. Rather than waiting for a single price objective, he encouraged holders to lock in gains gradually as XRP moves higher. His message is clear: successful trading is about protecting profits, not simply chasing lofty targets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Seasonal Tailwinds: Why Timing Matters Beyond the chart, Steph drew attention to seasonal market behavior, stressing that fear-driven exits could be premature. “This is not the time to be fearful, because historically Q4 always tends to be the best quarter for crypto ,” he said. This historical trend gives additional weight to the breakout scenario, suggesting that broader market conditions may align with the technical setup in favor of XRP. What Holders Should Take Away Steph’s alert is both a warning and an opportunity. Traders should confirm the breakout with their own charts, watch for strong volume to validate the move, and use the cited price levels as strategic checkpoints for profit-taking. His repeated reminder—“lock in the profits on the way up, secure your profits, guys”—underscores the importance of discipline in navigating volatile crypto rallies. The message is straightforward: a confirmed daily close above $3 could unlock the next leg higher for XRP, with price targets ranging from $3.60 to beyond $5. Steph’s analysis offers holders a structured plan—stay patient, wait for confirmation, and manage profits wisely. For XRP investors, this may be the alert that sets the tone for the final quarter of the year. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

        "url": "https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-treasury-push-vivopower-secures-19m-for-expansion/",
        "body": "London-based VivoPower International has raised $19 million in fresh equity at $6.05 per share, a premium to market, with the funds earmarked for its growing XRP digital asset treasury strategy. The move is seen as a show of the company’s deepening commitment to Ripple’s ecosystem at a time when the XRP price action is drawing both optimism and caution from market analysts. Strategic Expansion and Institutional Backing According to an October 1 press release, the raise will supplement a previously disclosed Regulation S offering led by Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki bin Talal Al Saud. It attracted long-term institutional investors in both the U.S. and abroad, with management saying that the fresh funds will support debt retirement while growing the firm’s digital asset strategy focused on the acquisition, management, and long-term holding of XRP. This latest financing follows an announcement in September by VivoPower of a $30 million partnership with Doppler Finance to deploy XRP reserves, the first phase of a planned $200 million allocation. At the same time, the company has been experimenting with Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin for cross-border transactions within its Tembo EV unit. Since early last month, Tembo has been accepting RLUSD for international payments, saying it offers faster settlement and reduced costs compared to traditional banking. However, the decision was not without controversy, sparking debate among XRP supporters about why the firm chose the stablecoin over XRP for payments, though VivoPower did not comment directly on the matter. The Nasdaq-listed firm is among the first to publicly commit sizable treasury resources to XRP, putting it in step with Ripple’s ecosystem growth in areas like tokenization and enterprise-grade payments. Market Context and XRP Performance The timing of VivoPower’s financing coincides with volatile yet largely positive XRP market performance. At the time of this writing, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading at $2.96, up 4.2% over 24 hours and 3.2% across the last seven days. However, it is still down 4.6% over the past fortnight. XRP is holding a 5.9% monthly gain, while its one-year performance shows a nearly 392% growth. The token’s July peak at $3.65 still stands as the all-time high, with current prices about 18.6% below that level. Meanwhile, analysts are still divided over its Q4 prospects. On October 1, market watcher Cobb told his nearly 200,000 followers on X that he sees a path to $6.32 this quarter. Others like Amonyx have set much bolder targets of up to $20, a level that would require XRP’s market cap to fly past $1 trillion. Despite the optimism, some critics have cautioned that the asset’s streak of five consecutive green quarterly closes may be due for a correction, leading to predictions of a red end to 2025.

Register your interest: https://t.co/z2rIAtXbwA pic.twitter.com/BXGXzFeUFh — Cardano Card (@cardano_card) September 23, 2025 Cardano Foundation just dropped the next phase of its roadmap, lining up some big moves to push adoption. One of the main plays is beefing up the Web3 adoption team, with a focus on integrations, listings, real-world assets, and overall ecosystem growth. To give DeFi a boost, they are rolling out an eight-figure ADA liquidity fund for stablecoin projects under the “ Stablecoin DeFi Liquidity Budget .” They are also putting 2 million ADA into the Venture Hub to back and mentor high-potential projects building on Cardano. Plus, they will delegate 220 million ADA to fresh DReps to keep governance even more decentralized. Another key step is launching a Real World Asset project worth over $10 million. On the marketing side, the budget is getting increased by 12%, with more push into inbound, paid campaigns, content, media, and events. All together, the 2025 roadmap feels like Cardano doubling down on ecosystem adoption and setting up for long-term growth. Cardano Price Prediction: Could ADA Be the Most Undervalued Altcoin Right Now? Source: ADAUSD / TradingView Cardano has held its long-term support and managed to break out of several triangles and falling channel setups. Even so, it is still moving inside a larger descending channel, bouncing from key support levels sitting around $0.74–$0.70. At the moment, ADA is testing the middle of that channel. A clean move above $0.90, where the sell wall is, could flip momentum bullish and open a path toward $1.20–$1.30. The RSI is bouncing back from mid-zones, showing fresh strength, while MACD is flattening, suggesting momentum might be getting ready to turn. ADA is currently trading near $0.85, still down 71% from its 2021 ATH. If it can finally break out of this channel, it could set off a real trend reversal and line up with many analysts’ Cardano price prediction. Meet the First Bitcoin Layer 2: Could It Outshine Cardano? Bitcoin Hyper is coming across as more than a meme play, pushing the narrative of being the first real Bitcoin Layer 2. Its presale has already racked up over $19.9M and the hype keeps snowballing. The mix of meme energy and actual utility is what makes it pop, catching attention from both degen traders and hardcore Bitcoin maxis. The project’s dApp delivers quick, lag-free transactions and can handle heavy traffic thanks to Solana’s scaling power. On top of that, its trustless bridge lets users mint Bitcoin 1:1 on Layer 2, keeping their BTC secure while also unlocking extra upside. At the moment, HYPER is sitting at only $0.013015, but staking is dishing out a huge 60 % APY. When you stack Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed and add in those rewards, it sets up like a recipe ready to blow up big. Check out the Bitcoin Hyper site to track whale moves and jump into the presale. You can scoop up HYPER with ETH, USDT, BNB, or even straight up with a credit card.

        "url": "https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-leads-uptober-maxi-doge-hype-builds/",
        "body": "October is already living up to its “Uptober” reputation, with the market flashing green on the first trading day of the month. Meme coins have bounced back to an $81 billion valuation, with Dogecoin (DOGE) leading the pack after a 9% overnight gain. But there’s a new pup ready to make its presence felt in this bullish revival: Maxi Doge (MAXI) . This jacked-up cousin of DOGE has his eyes straining pink – not from lack of sleep, but from reading every page of the “Book of Gains” in the “Broble”, searching for how far his muscles can take him in dethroning DOGE. And now every bro who’s studied the “Scriptures of Superset” can join in, by getting the token that best represents the grind they live by. But the clock is ticking. There are only 11 hours left for the chance to buy MAXI at $0.00026 before the next round starts with a higher price per token. DOGE’s Next Wave Could Push Meme Coins Higher Dogecoin is to the meme coin sector what Bitcoin is to crypto – the benchmark. The so-called “top dog” got there by being a pioneer and now carries a hefty $38 billion valuation. Investors who held DOGE through its early slumps were rewarded. From its lows in 2015, DOGE rocketed about 291,000%, turning many into crypto millionaires. But since peaking in 2021, DOGE has yet to reclaim its all-time high. At today’s price of $0.2546, it still sits about 65.3% below its peak – though steadily inching closer. One analyst, however, believes that DOGE is not just on track to revisit its $0.7316 ATH but to break far past it. Korean chartist XForce Global shared an Elliott Wave count showing DOGE finishing its corrective wave IV and entering wave V – the final bullish push of the cycle – with a target of $1.56 per DOGE in the main scenario. $DOGE Still very bullish on the macro for #DOGE . $DOGE still amazes me because it has a pretty conventional textbook 5-wave move since its inception. This cycle should finish with a ATH, w/ a minimum target around $1 (realistic), and a maximum target going into double digits. pic.twitter.com/8NcY32WyXo — XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) September 5, 2025 The pattern remains valid unless DOGE falls below its wave IV low, which so far has held. An alternative long-term count even projects DOGE could reach $16 within the next decade. If these predictions materialize, the impact on the meme coin sector could be massive, breathing new life and tons of fresh capital into the space. And just as DOGE once set the standard for meme coins, the door opens for others carrying the same banner culture that it waved proudly. But one contender is out to do more than follow. It wants to lift heavier, flex harder, and claim the spot as the true top dog. That’s none other than Maxi Doge . Against DOGE, MAXI Flexes the Full-Send Logic Only Bros Understand What Maxi Doge has is a chip on his shoulder – like slapping another plate on the bar just to prove a point. He’s here to show he’s the new alpha in town, rolling in with the kind of muscular build that says he never skips sets and eyes that look like they’ve stared down failure at 3 a.m. under a squat rack. That’s the frame he’s flexing to claim top dog status in the crypto space. Its appeal runs deep with the bros – the same guys who blast EDM until their ears ring and treat a 5,000-calorie cheat meal as a badge of honor. That all-in, all-out mentality spills straight into their trading appetite – chasing Ws whether it’s betting the house today or the kids tomorrow. For them, MAXI is the shining trophy of bro wisdom: if you shoot for 1,000x, you’d better believe you’re gonna get 1,000x. Because if you’re not aiming that high, then what’s the point of living anyway? And against DOGE, this kind of logic is unmatched. Only those who understand the pure art of “trust me bro investing” – the kind that outlifts Warren Buffett’s value strategy any day of the week – will grasp what it means to hold MAXI and reap the rewards when the pump hits. The Best Meme Coin of 2025? October is shaping up to show just how massive its run can get. Last year, meme coins were the ones that defined the second bullish wave in Q4 – and history could rhyme again this time around. In 2024, a handful of unexpected names stole the spotlight – tokens like Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT). If the market repeats that rhythm and the meme coin sector lifts again, there’s almost certainly going to be a new entrant climbing into the top 10. Maxi Doge isn’t just aiming for a seat at that table – he’s gunning straight past DOGE itself. The difference this time is that MAXI comes prepared. Its presale haul isn’t sitting idle as a huge portion is dedicated to making sure the project is seen, heard, and recognized by the bros who matter most. In fact, a full 60% of funds are concentrated on exposure – marketing, community, and hype mechanics – to make sure MAXI has every chance to step into the spotlight and claim its place as the next top meme coin. And bros are perhaps already taking notice – even top crypto outlet InsideBitcoins has featured MAXI in a video review, calling it the best new meme coin of 2025. Go 1,000x with Maxi Doge So if you’re ready to have your stake in what could be the dog that beats DOGE, head to the Maxi Doge Token official website and connect your favorite wallet such as Best Wallet, which is recognized as one of the best crypto wallets in the space. Swap ETH, BNB, USDT, or USDC, or pay directly with a bank card. Best Wallet can be downloaded on Google Play and the Apple App Store . You can stake your newly purchased MAXI tokens and generate passive yield by staking them in Maxi Doge’s staking protocol, generating a 127% dynamic APY . Find the like-minded bro community on Maxi Doge’s X and Telegram accounts. For added peace of mind, Maxi Doge has every bro covered on security – its smart contract has been fully audited by Coinsult and SOLIDProof .

Analysts now target $6,400 with multi-year projections between $7,000–$12,000, citing accumulation and macro adoption drivers. Strongest quarterly candle: ETH closed above $4,000, flipping resistance into support. On-chain withdrawals of ~420,000 ETH reduced exchange balances, indicating accumulation.

Ethereum breakout: ETH posts strongest quarterly close above $4,000; read expert targets and on-chain signals. View market levels, support and next steps. What is driving the Ethereum breakout above $4,000? Ethereum breakout was driven by a historic quarterly close that turned $4,000 resistance into support, combined with major on-chain withdrawals and renewed demand from institutional and retail buyers. Short-term momentum, reduced exchange supply, and bullish market structure supported upside projections. Ethereum records its strongest quarterly close above $4,000 with $6,400 in sight as analysts project $7K–$12K targets for 2025. Ethereum posts strongest quarterly candle, breaking $4,000 resistance with $6,400 target in sight. On-chain data shows 420,000 ETH withdrawn, reducing exchange supply and signaling strong accumulation. Analysts project Ethereum could reach $7,000–$12,000 in 2025, with possible extension toward $15,000. Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum after recording its most powerful quarterly candle on record. ETH broke above long-standing resistance and secured the highest quarterly close in history. Analysts and on-chain metrics indicate important upside targets and supportive fundamentals. How did Ethereum break resistance with the strongest quarterly close? Technical analysis shows repeated failures at $4,000 between 2022 and 2025 before a confirmed breakout. The breakout candle established new market structure and turned resistance into support, adding momentum to Ethereum’s upward trajectory. According to analysis prepared by Titan of Crypto, the quarterly consolidation ended with a decisive close that validated higher highs and higher lows since early 2023. That structure fueled short-term targets while reinforcing longer-term bullish scenarios. #Ethereum is Insanely Bullish Right Now #ETH just broke out with its strongest quarterly candle ever. Target could be $6,400. pic.twitter.com/cvOMiTFCT9 — Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) October 1, 2025 Chart projections highlighted an initial upside objective near $6,400, with additional longer-range projections toward $6,800 and above. Market structure confirmed sustained buying pressure and higher demand throughout recent quarters. Source: CoinMarketCap Each quarterly candle reinforced the bullish structure and placed Ethereum within reach of higher targets. At the time of this report ETH traded at $4,392.51 with a daily gain of 1.81% and a market capitalization of $530.19 billion. Daily trading volume measured $45.56 billion, up 5.51%. Why are on-chain withdrawals significant for price momentum? On-chain metrics showed roughly 420,000 ETH withdrawn from exchange wallets, sending exchange balances to nine-year lows. This reduction in available supply typically lowers selling pressure and signals accumulation by larger holders. Withdrawal data (source: Coinglass, presented as plain text) suggests a tightening supply-demand dynamic. Lower exchange balances historically correlate with improved price resilience during bullish runs. Market Activity and Expert Predictions At Korea Blockchain Week 2025, Tom Lee (FundStrat) projected that Ethereum could reach $7,000–$12,000 by year-end, with a possible extension toward $15,000 within a new multi-year cycle. He cited artificial intelligence and finance as structural demand drivers. Source: MichaelvandePoppe(X) Analyst Michael van de Poppe noted that Ethereum has been holding up well versus Bitcoin, pointing to continued momentum. ETH/BTC displayed a 144.27% rise since May 2025 before a retracement to 0.03664, with clear buying zones identified. What are the immediate technical levels to watch? Immediate support sits near $4,300. Key upside objectives include $4,406 and $4,565 followed by projection targets at $6,400 and higher. Traders should monitor exchange balances, liquidity zones, and quarter-over-quarter market structure for confirmation.

About 420,000 ETH were withdrawn, pushing exchange balances to nine-year lows. This matters because lower exchange supply reduces potential selling pressure and often correlates with stronger price support. Will analyst targets guarantee price movement to $7,000–$12,000? Analyst targets reflect scenarios based on current momentum and macro themes; they are not guarantees. These projections incorporate technical structure, on-chain flows, and macro adoption indicators. Key Takeaways Breakout confirmed : Ethereum closed the quarter above $4,000, converting resistance into support. On-chain accumulation : ~420,000 ETH withdrawn from exchanges signals lower sell pressure. Analyst outlook : Targets range from $6,400 near-term to $7K–$12K for 2025, with some extensions toward $15K; monitor support and exchange flows. Conclusion This report shows Ethereum in a strong bullish phase after the highest quarterly close in history, supported by significant on-chain withdrawals and bullish market structure. Watch $4,300 as immediate support and aggregate analyst targets for longer-term planning.

        "body": "Summary XRP traded at $2.96 after rebounding from the $2.84 to $2.85 support cluster near the 100-day EMA. Derivatives activity rose, with futures volume up 35% to $6.7 billion and open interest at $7.87 billion. Net inflows of $10.38 million on Oct. 2 signaled fresh spot demand as funding stayed modestly positive. By Jainam Mehta XRP ( XRP-USD ) traded near $2.96 on Thursday as the market tried to reclaim momentum following weeks of compression inside a descending setup. Buyers again defended the $2.84 to $2.85 area, where horizontal demand aligns with the 100-day exponential moving average. XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView) That zone has absorbed multiple selloffs since mid-August and remains a primary line of defense. Momentum has begun to stabilize. The Relative Strength Index rose to 53 and crossed above its signal, pointing to improving short-term strength without overbought conditions. The 20-day EMA at $2.91 flipped back into play as intraday support, and price is now testing the upper boundary of the pattern. A daily close above $3.00 to $3.05 would be the first constructive step toward reversing the broader downtrend and would shift focus to higher resistance zones. On the topside, successive ceilings sit at $3.05 to $3.10, followed by $3.25 and $3.45. A stronger run could put $3.60 on the radar if momentum accelerates. On the downside, a return to $2.84 to $2.85 would test the durability of the base. A decisive failure there would expose $2.62 at the 200-day EMA. Futures and options show renewed appetite Derivatives positioning strengthened alongside price. Aggregate futures trading volume jumped 35 percent to $6.7 billion. Open interest increased nearly 6 percent to $7.87 billion, a sign that fresh capital is entering the market rather than only rotating within existing positions. Options activity surged as well. Total options volume rose 52 percent, while options open interest fell 36 percent. The combination implies that traders added near-term exposure but trimmed hedges, a setup that can magnify follow-through if price clears nearby resistance. Long and short ratios on major venues tilted bullish. Binance accounts showed a 3.28 ratio in favor of longs, while top trader positioning skewed above 2.6. Liquidation data pointed to heavier losses for shorts, suggesting pressure could intensify if price pushes through the $3 handle. Funding rates stayed slightly positive across major futures venues. The absence of extreme funding reduces the risk of a sudden squeeze in either direction and supports a more orderly advance if spot demand persists. Spot flows turn positive as accumulation resurfaces On-chain and exchange flows added to the constructive tone. On Oct. 2, XRP recorded net inflows of $10.38 million, coinciding with the push toward $2.97. The figure contrasts with the outflow pattern that dominated prior weeks and implies that some traders are shifting from defense to accumulation near the established base. One session does not set a lasting trend, but the turn in flows is consistent with improving technical conditions above the 20-day EMA. Market structure remains sensitive to headlines and broad risk appetite. Even so, the alignment of rising futures interest, firmer spot flows, and a defended 100-day EMA gives bulls a clearer path, provided price can establish acceptance above $3.00. XRP short-term outlook XRP’s near-term path hinges on the $3.00 to $3.05 zone. A close above that band would confirm a break of descending supply and open room toward $3.25, then $3.45. If momentum extends, $3.60 becomes a stretch target. Failure to clear $3.05 risks a return to $2.84 to $2.85, with a deeper test toward $2.62 if the base gives way. Previously, we noted that XRP’s triangle compression and persistent exchange outflows kept rallies capped near $3.00. The recent combination of net inflows, stronger futures participation, and a rebound off the 100-day EMA suggests that dynamic is beginning to shift. Bulls still need confirmation through a clean break of resistance, but the balance of forces is more supportive than it was in September.

RLUSD minting refers to Ripple Labs adding $1.8 million of supply to its RLUSD stablecoin, increasing its total valuation to about $789 million. This expansion matters because fresh stablecoin issuance can indicate incoming liquidity and higher buying capacity for spot markets. How does RLUSD minting affect altcoins and XRP? New stablecoins typically act as market liquidity reservoirs that traders use to buy altcoins and major tokens. With the overall crypto market cap near $4 trillion and the stablecoin market capitalisation around $309 billion, added RLUSD supply can support increased trading and price discovery. Data points to watch: the Altcoin Season Index reading of 66 suggests growing altcoin demand (a 75+ reading confirms a broad altseason). The Fear & Greed Index at 51 shows neutral sentiment while investors accumulate selectively. Stablecoin market as a signal: What should traders watch? Stablecoin minting is often a short-term liquidity gauge. When issuers add supply, it implies capital is ready to flow into markets rather than sit idle. Key metrics: total stablecoin cap (~$309B), 24H stablecoin trading volume (~$206B), and rank changes in stablecoin market share. Monitoring these helps assess whether RLUSD’s mint leads to sustained asset purchases. Source: TradingView (plain text) RLUSD’s $1.8M mint coincided with the crypto market reclaiming the $4 trillion threshold, a sign that investors are rotating capital back into crypto. Historically, such recoveries increase on-chain activity and exchange inflows. How is the Altcoin Season Index shaping expectations? The Altcoin Season Index at 66 signals rising altcoin breadth but not a full altseason. At 75+ the market typically shows widespread alt gains; current readings suggest pockets of strength with room to run. Investors should balance position sizing and watch on-chain spot flows for confirmation. Source: CoinMarketCap (plain text) Are investors buying XRP now? Netflow data shows mixed behavior. Between 28 September and 1 October, buyers accumulated roughly $110.9 million of XRP. A short-term reversal returned about $20.05 million in the 24-hour period ending 2 October, indicating renewed spot demand. Technicals: XRP formed a bull-flag pattern on daily charts with a near-term measured target around $3.50. The Accumulation/Distribution indicator trending positive supports buying pressure; market volume near 74.75 billion XRP shows activity remains elevated. Source: Coinglass (plain text) Traders should combine on-chain netflow, stablecoin issuance, and technical patterns before acting. RLUSD’s mint is a liquidity event, not a directional certainty; watch spot flows into exchanges, orderbook depth, and major support/resistance levels. Source: TradingView (plain text) Frequently Asked Questions How large is RLUSD after the $1.8M mint? RLUSD’s market valuation is roughly $789 million after the $1.8 million mint, placing it among the top ten stablecoins by capitalization at publication time. Can RLUSD minting trigger an altcoin rally? RLUSD minting can add liquidity that fuels altcoin purchases, but a sustained rally requires broad stablecoin supply growth plus favorable on-chain flows and market sentiment. What technical signs support an XRP breakout? XRP’s daily bull-flag pattern, rising A/D indicator, and positive spot netflows suggest a higher-probability breakout, with a near-term target around $3.50 if volume confirms the move. { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How large is RLUSD after the $1.8M mint?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"RLUSD’s market valuation is roughly $789 million after the $1.8 million mint, placing it among the top ten stablecoins by capitalization at publication time.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Can RLUSD minting trigger an altcoin rally?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"RLUSD minting can add liquidity that supports altcoin purchases, but a sustained rally requires broader stablecoin growth, sustained on-chain inflows, and improving sentiment.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"What technical signs support an XRP breakout?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"A bull-flag on daily charts, rising Accumulation/Distribution values, and positive spot netflows are the primary technical and flow-based signs that support a potential XRP breakout.\" } } ]} { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"HowTo\", \"name\": \"How to interpret RLUSD minting signals\", \"step\": [ { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/#step1\", \"name\": \"Check stablecoin supply\", \"itemListElement\": { \"@type\": \"HowToDirection\", \"text\": \"Confirm the amount minted and the updated market cap of RLUSD.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/#step2\", \"name\": \"Monitor on-chain flows\", \"itemListElement\": { \"@type\": \"HowToDirection\", \"text\": \"Watch spot exchange netflows and stablecoin movement to exchanges.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"HowToStep\", \"url\": \"https://en.coinotag.com/#step3\", \"name\": \"Combine with technicals\", \"itemListElement\": { \"@type\": \"HowToDirection\", \"text\": \"Use chart patterns and volume confirmation before taking positions.\" } } ]} Key Takeaways RLUSD minting: A $1.8M addition lifted RLUSD to ~$789M, signaling added liquidity potential.

        "title": "Euro’s Death Spiral Makes Bitcoin The New Reserve: Arthur Hayes",
        "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/euro-death-bitcoin-new-reserve-arthur-hayes/",
        "body": "Arthur Hayes centers Bitcoin as the primary beneficiary of what he calls an inevitable ECB money-printing cycle triggered by France’s worsening funding position, capital flight, and political stalemate. In his Oct. 2, 2025 essay “Bastille Day,” Hayes argues that the developing fracture is not merely a euro story but a reserve-asset reshuffle that elevates BTC because it is a portable, bearer instrument outside the reach of Eurozone gatekeepers. “The slow-motion collapse of the French state is the signal that it’s time to sell euros and buy Bitcoin,” he writes, later distilling the trade into a binary: “Either the ECB presses the Brrr button now and implicitly finances the French welfare state, or it does it later when French capital controls threaten to destroy the euro. Either way, money gets printed in the trillions of euros.” As France Breaks The Euro, Bitcoin Becomes The Escape Hayes treats Bitcoin not as a speculative risk asset but as the neutral reserve standing opposite fiat debasement and capital controls. He frames the immediate hedge as operationally simple for Eurozone savers: “Bitcoin is the best way to preserve options… it is a digital bearer asset. In a few minutes, you can convert your euro bank balance into Bitcoin using a spot exchange on the continent. And voila, you are no longer Lagarde’s bitch.” That prescription is the capstone to his analysis of France’s TARGET2 deficit and reliance on foreign creditors. With “59% of French OAT government bonds with maturity over one year” and “70% of French long-term bank debt” held abroad, he contends the financing base is fragile. If foreign holders are haircut or flee, he expects the ECB’s response to be large and fast: “If these assets get wiped out, the EU banking system is approaching insolvency on an unlevered basis. To save the EU banking system, the ECB would print EUR 5.02 trillion.” The central mechanism that connects France’s stress to a BTC bid, in Hayes’s telling, is the acceleration of deposit migration across the euro area’s settlement rails. He points to the shift in national TARGET balances since 2020 to argue that “French savers increasingly do not believe that their euros are safe within the French banking system.” Once that confidence is impaired, he says, the scramble for exits will narrow toward scarce, self-custodiable assets . “These euros effectively pump Bitcoin and gold as the only two hard assets any investor with a single neuron would purchase in this situation,” he writes, before returning to BTC as the cleanest expression of neutrality: “Bitcoin doesn’t care and will continue its inexorable rise versus the piece of trash that is the euro.” Hayes pushes the Bitcoin-first framing through multiple contingencies. If the ECB withholds support to discipline Paris, he expects bank stress to worsen and capital to move faster, enriching the BTC bid. If the ECB capitulates early, he expects balance-sheet expansion to debase the unit of account, also enriching the BTC bid. “The ECB will valiantly print money to forestall the loss of its raison d’être,” he writes. “It shall be a glorious day for the faithful as printed euros will combine with printed dollars, yuan, yen, etc to bid up the price of Bitcoin.” Even a hypothetical French exit and a weaker franc doesn’t alter the destination in his view; it merely shifts the channel through which policy redistributes losses. “Locals who still hold French financial assets still have time to get out… But when they come, you cannot withdraw much in the way of physical euro cash, or wire euros outside of the French banking system, or escape by buying Bitcoin and gold.” To scope magnitude, Hayes offers directional estimates that emphasize speed rather than precision. He notes “domestic French banking deposits totaled EUR 2.6 tn” as of July 2025 and estimates “25% of this capital could leave within a few days… This amounts to EUR 650 bn.” Applying the same heuristic to “$3.45 trillion” in equities and “$3.25 trillion” in government bonds, he argues that “hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars could quickly leave France and find a home in Bitcoin and gold if domestic capital gets spooked.” His caveat is explicit—“Of course, this is a shitty estimate”—but it serves the thesis that flow urgency, not fine-tuned arithmetic, is what matters for BTC’s upside convexity when fiat systems wobble . The political overlay is instrumental to his Bitcoin call. Hayes portrays the ECB as prioritizing institutional control over currency stability, which, he says, paradoxically intensifies the need for an eventual rescue. “The ECB is so focused on control of Europe that it’s cutting off its nose to spite its face,” he writes, arguing that disciplining deficits while French funding frays accelerates deposit migration and forces larger printing later. He collapses that loop back to BTC with a refrain that runs through the essay: “Sell euros and buy Bitcoin.” For readers outside Europe, Hayes’s guidance does not change with geography; the driver is money creation, not local banking architecture. “If you are not a denizen of Europe do not buy European financial assets under any circumstances. Instead, buy some Bitcoin, sit back and watch your sick gainz as printed euros contribute to the bull market in growth of the fiat money supply.” For those inside the bloc, the imperative is timing around potential restrictions: “There are no domestic capital controls yet,” he writes of France. “But when they come… your freedom to escape by buying Bitcoin… will wane rather than wax.” At press time, BTC traded at $118,597.",

        "body": "Robinhood added Stretch (STRC), the latest preferred stock of Strategy. With the latest addition, Robinhood taps an even wider buyer base of retail investors. Robinhood added access to Stretch (STRC), Strategy’s variable-rate, perpetual preferred stock. STRC was launched with a face value of $100 and 9% annualized dividend paid monthly, though it traded at $99 after the Robinhood listing, with an effective rate of 10.34%. STRC is now available to trade on @RobinhoodApp ! https://t.co/mEFNmwsgsS — Strategy (@Strategy) October 2, 2025 STRC aims to raise funds for Strategy while competing with traditional fixed-income products. STRC debuted in July, launching with a price of $90 during a period of relatively low market demand. The launch of STRC on Robinhood immediately reached influencers on crypto social media, buying the preferred shares as a form of support for Strategy. For Robinhood, this will be a new class of assets to be offered to the retail user base. STRC taps a low-risk strategy with a monthly curated dividend. Strategy announces the monthly dividend each month, to keep the price of STRC as close as possible to $100. STRC was the last asset to be added to Strategy’s portfolio, managing to raise $2.47B during its placement in July. STRC offers a complex investment product for retail buyers The goal of STRC is stability and predictability, achieving a fixed-income product with BTC backing. STRC is above STRD, STRK, and MSTR common stock in terms of investor priority, but below STRF and senior debt. STRC aims for price stability, achieved through a variable monthly dividend and an embedded call option to control the price above $100. | Source: Google Finance STRC looks like a simple product for retail investors, but it is in fact a complex investment product with mechanisms to stabilize the price. Strategy can decide to issue STRC, or exercise an embedded call option if STRC exceeds its upper band. STRC is less risky than the STRD product, allowing Strategy to layer risk in different products with various levels of seniority. STRC advertises itself as an investment-grade product, with over 10X backing in BTC based on seniority. For now, Strategy has not sold any BTC to improve its structure, but in theory, it could cover the dividends for STRC and STRF, the two investment-grade products. Robinhood taps 25.9M potential investors for Strategy Robinhood now carries STRC, STRK, and STRF, so far avoiding the riskier STRD product. MSTR is also available to retail buyers for the simplest and most volatile strategy. The addition of those complex assets breaks away from Robinhood’s practice of avoiding preferred shares. The asset listing reaches 25.9M retail investors, potentially giving Strategy more leeway for its purchases. The addition of a wider retail market follows a period where Strategy was buying relatively small weekly amounts of BTC, sparking fears of more difficult fundraising. However, Strategy can also achieve rapid reversals during BTC rallies. Common stock MSTR rallied to over $348, up from a recent low just above $300. A market improvement means Strategy can begin reacting immediately, issuing at-the-market shares. This would in turn translate to higher BTC prices and larger weekly purchases.
