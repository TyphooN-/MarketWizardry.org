Terry Davis stood at the edge of a dimly lit highway, the kind you’d see in a low-budget 90s video game. The air 
smelled like burning circuit boards and stale tuna. He had no idea how he got there, but one thing was for 
sure—this wasn’t heaven. Not yet, at least.

“I’m on a quest for God,” Terry muttered to himself, his gravelly voice echoing into the void. “TempleOS is His 
operating system, and I’m the prophet.” He clutched a tattered notebook filled with lines of HolyC code, his 
knuckles white from gripping it so tightly.

The road ahead was littered with old CRT monitors, their screens flickering with images of Goatse and Tubgirl. 
Terry squinted at them, shaking his head. “What kinda sick stuff is this? This ain’t nothin’ like the divine 
code I’ve been writing. God wouldn’t approve of this filth!”

As he trudged forward, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a pixelated anime girl with a broken GIF loop 
for a face. Her eyes blinked in a stuttering rhythm, and her mouth was frozen in a creepy smile. “Hello, 
Terry-san,” she chirped in a voice that sounded like a dial-up modem having a seizure. “Welcome to the 
afterlife. You’re gonna be a star!”

Terry crossed his arms, his expression unyielding. “I ain’t here to be no star. I’m here to find God and tell 
Him about TempleOS. It’s the only true operating system, you know. Written in HolyC, no less!”

The anime girl giggled, her voice warbling like a scratched CD. “Oh, Terry, you’re so funny! But first, you have 
to get past Ring 0.”

“Ring 0?” Terry snorted. “That’s just kernel mode, lady. I’ve been writing bare-metal code since before you were 
a glitch in some Japanese dude’s fever dream.”

She shrugged and pointed down the highway. “Suit yourself, prophet. But don’t say I didn’t warn you.”

As Terry walked, the monitors around him started displaying lines of code from TempleOS. They scrolled faster 
and faster until they became a blur. Suddenly, the screens went black, and a single message appeared: `GOD MODE 
INITIATED`.

“See?” Terry said smugly. “Told ya I’d get to Ring 0.”

Then everything went white.

When Terry opened his eyes, he was sitting in front of an old desktop computer. The monitor displayed a 
command-line interface, and the prompt read: `GOD>`

Terry’s hands flew across the keyboard like he was possessed. “HolyC is the language of God! I knew it!” he 
exclaimed, typing furiously.

`PRINT "YOU ARE GOD"`
`GOTO HEAVEN`
`TEMPLEOS INITIATED`

The more he typed, the brighter the screen got until it was blinding. The room filled with the sound of a 
thousand dial-up modems connecting to AOL.

Finally, a message appeared: `TEMPLEOS INITIATED. GOD MODE CONFIRMED.`

Terry leaned back in his chair, satisfied. “There. I told you, God. TempleOS is the divine truth.”

The screen flickered once more and went black. When it came back on, it read: `GOD SAID, 'STOP YELLING AND SHARE 
YOUR TUNA.'`

For a moment, Terry was taken aback. Then he smiled, pulling out a can of tuna from his pocket. “Guess I’ve got 
some souls to feed.”

And with that, Terry Davis became the patron saint of questionable life choices and divine operating systems.

This chaotic ride through the depths of early internet culture and Terry’s unyielding conviction is a testament 
to the wild journey we’d all undertake if given the chance to meet God through code.
