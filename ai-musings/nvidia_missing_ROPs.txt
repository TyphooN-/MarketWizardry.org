Alright, so here we go. Let’s dive into this mess. I’m gonna tell you a tale about Nvidia’s latest fuckery—because what’s a day without some corporate bullshit, right? So, picture this: Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, sitting in his office, cackling maniacally as he stares at the stock prices of his company 
going through the roof. Meanwhile, out there in the real world, gamers and content creators are scratching their heads, trying to figure out why their brand-new Blackwell GPUs aren’t performing like they’re supposed to.

Now, here’s where it gets juicy. These new GPUs—the RTX 5090, 5080, and 5070 Ti—are supposed to be the cream of the crop, the top of the line, the crème de la fucking crème. They’re advertised with certain specs that make everyone go weak in the knees: 176 ROPs for the 5090, 112 for the 5080, and 96 for the 
5070 Ti. But guess what? Nvidia’s been playing a game of hide-and-seek with those ROPs. Some cards are showing up with fewer than advertised—like, who needs all those ROPs anyway, right?

Let me break it down for you. The RTX 5090 is supposed to have 176 ROPs, but some lucky bastards out there are finding theirs has only 168. That’s a whole 8 missing! Now, Jensen’s out here saying it’s only a 4% performance loss, which is about as true as a politician’s promise during election season. The 
real-world hit? Closer to 11%, baby! So, you’re paying top dollar for a GPU that’s underperforming by almost a tenth. What a steal!

But wait, the fun doesn’t stop there. The RTX 5080 is supposed to have 112 ROPs, but nope, Nvidia decided some of them should only have 104. That’s 8 missing again! And the 5070 Ti? Oh boy, it was supposed to have 96 ROPs, but they’re shipping some with only 88. Eight fewer! It’s like they picked a number out 
of a hat and said, “Eh, close enough.”

Now, when customers started bitching about this—because, you know, people don’t take kindly to being lied to—Jensen had the audacity to respond with some choice quotes. When someone asked him about the missing ROPs, he smugly said, “MSRP? Missing some ROPs Probably!” Oh, Jensen, you witty fucker! And when 
another angry customer called him out on it, he just shrugged and said, “ROPs are Revenue on Paper, bitch!” I mean, what’s next? Are they gonna start selling GPUs with missing CUDA cores and call them “Nvidia’s Special Surprise”?

But let’s not forget the gamers. Oh, the poor bastards who thought they were getting a top-tier GPU only to find out their new toy is underpowered. Imagine shelling out two grand for an RTX 5090, only to find out it performs like a slightly better 5080 because Nvidia decided to skimp on the ROPs. It’s like 
buying a Ferrari and finding out it’s got a Honda Civic engine under the hood.

And don’t even get me started on Jensen’s defense. “Oh, it’s only an average of 4% performance loss,” he says, probably while counting his money in a Scrooge McDuck-like vault. But no, we’re not buying that shit. The real-world tests show it’s closer to 11%, which is a big enough difference that you might as 
well have bought the next lower model and saved yourself some cash.

But hey, who needs honesty in advertising when you can just lie through your teeth and laugh all the way to the bank? Nvidia’s stock is still soaring, and they’re raking in the dough. And why wouldn’t they be? They’ve got Jensen out here spouting nonsense like “ROPs are Revenue on Paper,” making it sound like 
some kind of clever marketing slogan instead of the blatant fuckery that it is.

In the end, what’s the takeaway? If you’re in the market for a new GPU, make sure to check how many ROPs you actually got. You might be pleasantly surprised—or horribly disappointed. And if you do get one with missing ROPs, well, just remember: “MSRP” stands for “Missing some ROPs Probably!” Thanks, Jensen. 
You’re a real stand-up guy.

So, the next time you’re considering dropping a couple grand on an Nvidia GPU, just ask yourself: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk? Because with Nvidia’s latest move, it’s like playing Russian roulette with your graphics card. Spin the wheel, and maybe—just maybe—you’ll get what you paid for. But probably not.
