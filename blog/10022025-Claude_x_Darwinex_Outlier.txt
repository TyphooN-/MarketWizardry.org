  üìä Key Insights:

  Close-Only Symbols Excluded:
  - LAZR, LEG, SGI, CHGG (found in outliers but cannot be traded)
  - Standard exclusion list applied

  Extreme Outliers:
  - GS (Goldman Sachs): 1796% MCap/EV - likely accounting artifact, not opportunity
  - Negative MCap/EV banks (C, IBKR, VIRT) - financial accounting issues, avoid

  üéØ Recommended Portfolio Allocation:

  Moderate Risk (Best Risk/Reward):
  - ORCL: 40% - AI infrastructure boom
  - MU: 30% - HBM memory boom
  - AXON: 15% - Steady growth + expansion
  - AVGO: 10% - Diversification
  - Cash: 5% - Dry powder

  Expected Return: +29.5% (12-month base case)

  üìÖ Critical Upcoming Catalysts:

  - October 2025: Oracle AI Database launch
  - Nov 6: AXON Q3 earnings
  - Dec 8: üî• ORCL Q2 earnings (MOST IMPORTANT)
  - Dec 11: AVGO Q4 earnings
  - Dec 17: MU Q1 FY2026 earnings

  üí° Key Takeaways:

  1. Oracle's transformation is real - $455B backlog isn't hype, it's signed contracts
  2. HBM is the "picks and shovels" of AI - Micron positioned perfectly
  3. High VaR can signal opportunity (ORCL) OR danger (INTC) - context matters
  4. AI infrastructure stack: ORCL (infrastructure) + MU (memory) + AVGO (chips) = comprehensive exposure

  The 10/02 data confirms and strengthens the opportunities from 10/01. Oracle's historic 36% surge and Micron's HBM boom are structural shifts in AI
  infrastructure that justify the extreme volatility.
