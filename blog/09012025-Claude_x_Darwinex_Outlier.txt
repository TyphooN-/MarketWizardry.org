  ‚è∞ EXECUTION PRIORITY

  Immediate Buy (Week 1)

  1. SKX - Statistical anomaly may correct quickly
  2. GTLS - Infrastructure momentum building

  Staged Entry (Weeks 2-4)

  3. CC - Dollar-cost average as Samsung partnership gets recognized
  4. ENPH - Solar sector volatile, spread purchases

  Opportunistic (Month 2+)

  5. Monitor CABO for debt reduction progress
  6. Add ARCC on any dividend yield spike

  The revised analysis focuses exclusively on actionable, tradeable positions while maintaining the statistical edge from the VaR/Ask anomalies. SKX and GTLS remain the highest
  conviction plays due to their extreme statistical undervaluation combined with strong fundamental catalysts.
