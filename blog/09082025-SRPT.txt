‚óè üö® THE ELEVIDYS TRIAL CONCERNS - DETAILED BREAKDOWN

  The ELEVIDYS controversy is one of the most significant regulatory battles in recent FDA history. Here's what went wrong and why it matters for SRPT investors:

  üí• THE CORE CLINICAL TRIAL PROBLEMS

  Primary Endpoint Failures:

  - BOTH Phase 3 trials FAILED their primary functional endpoints
  - No measurable clinical benefit demonstrated vs. placebo
  - 4-7 year old patients showed no meaningful improvement in muscle function
  - Functional tests (walking, climbing stairs) showed no difference from placebo

  What This Means:

  The drug didn't actually help kids walk better, climb stairs, or maintain muscle function - the things that matter most to DMD patients and families.

  üî¨ THE SURROGATE ENDPOINT CONTROVERSY

  What Sarepta Did:

  - Failed functional endpoints ‚Üí Pivoted to "surrogate endpoint"
  - Micro-dystrophin expression in muscle tissue became the new measure
  - Argued: If we can make protein in muscle, it should work clinically

  The Problem:

  - FDA reviewers found: "Micro-dystrophin levels were NOT correlated with muscle function"
  - Translation: Making protein ‚â† clinical benefit
  - FDA scientific staff: "Data insufficient to support micro-dystrophin as surrogate endpoint"

  üèõÔ∏è THE UNPRECEDENTED FDA OVERRIDE

  What Happened:

  - THREE separate FDA review teams ‚Üí REJECTED the application
  - Two top FDA officials ‚Üí REJECTED the application
  - Peter Marks (CBER Director) ‚Üí OVERRULED EVERYONE

  The Opposition Letter:

  FDA directors Lola Fashoyin-Aje and Nicole Verdun wrote to Marks:
  "ELEVIDYS failed two consecutive, placebo-controlled trials... results cannot support effectiveness"

  Unprecedented Nature:

  - First time in recent FDA history a single official overruled multiple review teams
  - Internal revolt within FDA scientific staff
  - Public criticism from FDA's own reviewers

  üíÄ THE SAFETY CRISIS (2025)

  Patient Deaths:

  - March 2025: First teenage patient dies of acute liver failure
  - June 2025: Second patient dies of acute liver failure
  - July 2025: Third patient (51-year-old) dies of liver failure
  - Both DMD deaths: Non-ambulatory patients

  FDA Response:

  - Shipment halt requested by FDA
  - Sarepta initially refused to comply
  - Eventually complied under pressure
  - Ambulatory patients: Shipments resumed after investigation
  - Non-ambulatory patients: Still halted (where deaths occurred)

  ‚öóÔ∏è KNOWN DANGEROUS SIDE EFFECTS

  Immune-Mediated Myositis:

  - Severe muscle weakness ~1 month after infusion
  - Difficulty swallowing, breathing, speaking
  - Particularly in patients with specific gene deletions (exon 8/9)

  Other Serious Adverse Events:

  - Acute liver injury (potentially fatal)
  - Myocarditis (heart inflammation)
  - Immune reactions against the gene therapy vector

  üé≠ THE POLITICAL CONTROVERSY

  Peter Marks' Role:

  - Single-handedly approved against scientific consensus
  - Left FDA in early 2025 amid controversy
  - His departure created uncertainty for all gene therapies
  - Successor more conservative on approvals

  Industry Impact:

  - Pfizer discontinued their DMD gene therapy after similar failures
  - All 5 FDA-approved DMD drugs: Used accelerated approval pathway
  - None have shown convincing clinical benefits vs. placebo
  - $3.2 million price tag for unproven therapy

  üìä WHY THIS CREATES THE SRPT TRADING OPPORTUNITY

  The Regulatory Uncertainty:

  - Will new FDA leadership revoke approval?
  - Will additional safety data emerge?
  - Can Sarepta prove clinical benefit in new trials?
  - Will insurance/Medicare continue paying $3.2M per patient?

  The Binary Outcomes:

  ‚úÖ Bull Case:
  - ELEVIDYS commercial success continues
  - Safety profile stabilizes
  - New leadership doesn't revoke approval
  - Additional indications approved
  - Stock could double/triple

  ‚ùå Bear Case:
  - FDA revokes approval
  - More safety issues emerge
  - Insurance stops covering
  - Clinical benefit never proven
  - Stock could lose 70-80%

  üé≤ TRADING IMPLICATIONS

  This controversy explains WHY SRPT has 116% monthly volatility:

  1. Regulatory Risk: Approval could be revoked
  2. Safety Risk: More deaths could halt program
  3. Efficacy Questions: Drug may not actually work
  4. Commercial Risk: $3.2M price unsustainable if no benefit
  5. Leadership Changes: New FDA officials may be stricter

  Every News Cycle Could Move Stock 20-50%:

  - FDA policy announcements
  - Safety updates
  - Efficacy data releases
  - Insurance coverage decisions
  - Congressional hearings on drug pricing

  üß† THE BOTTOM LINE

  ELEVIDYS is potentially the most controversial drug approval in recent FDA history:

  - Failed clinical trials but approved anyway
  - FDA internal revolt against approval
  - Patient deaths from liver failure
  - No proven clinical benefit despite $3.2M cost
  - Unprecedented regulatory override by single official

  This creates massive volatility because the drug's future hangs on regulatory and safety developments that could go either way. The 116% monthly ATR reflects this binary uncertainty.

  For traders: This controversy IS the opportunity - the market is pricing in massive uncertainty, creating big moves on any news.

  For investors: Understand you're betting on a drug that failed trials but generates massive revenue - ultimate high-risk/high-reward biotech play.
